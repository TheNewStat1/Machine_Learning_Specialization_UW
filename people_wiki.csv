kurt elling to jaco pastorius mike manieri and randy breckermusic chose me at a very early age says mintzer i was completely taken by the 12 tones whether hearing music played on the radio television recordings or live concerts around the new york city area i was not only struck by the emotional outpouring of great musical performance but also found myself completely consumed with how the music fit together in all its glorious detail i could spend hours sitting at a piano trying to replicate the songs i would hear others playjazzmobile an organization that sponsored jazz performances around the greater new york metropolitan area sent a quintet consisting of dr billy taylor grady tate ron carter harold land and blue mitchell to the new rochelle high school in 1967 i was a sophomore at the time i think it was then and there that i decided that music would be my calling later that year i was taken to the village gate to hear the double bill of the miles davis quintet and the thelonious monk quartet from that point on i went to as many live performances as i could on the budget of a 1618 year old during my formative years i was so fortunate to have the opportunity to hear sonny rollins miles monk sonny stitt dexter gordon chick corea herbie hancock and many of the jazz greats play around new yorkin 1969 my folks had the foresight to encourage me to audition for the interlochen arts academy in michigan i received a scholarship to attend this great school for my senior year of high school my classmates were peter erskine danny brubeck elaine duvas principal oboist in the metropolitan opera orchestra and tom hulce who played mozart in the film amadeus this year provided the inspiration and information that was to establish my practice and training regimen for years to come i was studying classical clarinet playing guitar and piano learning how to play the saxophone and flutelearning songs and writing tunes for the little combos we would put togetherin 1970 mintzer attended the hartt college of music in hartford connecticut on a classical clarinet scholarship jackie mclean had just started a jazz program at hart and mintzer spent time with mclean while working on a multitude of skillsi was very interested in all kinds of music and was attempting to learn how to play flutes clarinets saxophones piano work on composition and get my school work done mintzer explains i played clarinet in the orchestra and various chamber music groups i also played early music in a small group for a while there were some crazy rhythms in much of early music that paralleled what jazz improvisers were doing as far as playing over the bar line it was all fantastic after school i would listen to jazz recordings and go and sit in with local jazz musicians there was a pretty vibrant scene at that time around hartford where one core group of musicians were working 6 nights a week in different jointsmclean eventually pushed mintzer to consider moving down to new york city and jump into the jazz community down there he took the suggestion and transferred to manhattan school of music in 1973 at that time there was a lot of playing going on in the lofts which were commercial spaces newly converted to living quarters and very affordablemintzers contemporaries during the period were michael brecker dave liebman steve grossman richie bierach john abercrombie and countless other musicians the musicians i encountered in nyc in the early 70s were all about the music mintzer remembers rents were affordable and guys would get together in the lofts to play and compare ideas everyones aspiration was to land a gig with a working jazz group in the interim i paid the rent doing whatever would come along from subbing in broadway shows to doing odd recording sessions or club datesin 1974 mintzer was recommended to eumir deodato by a manhattan school of music classmate mintzer toured with deodato for one year playing large venues all over the world eumir had a hit record with his rendition of the strauss zarathustra melody he was a terrific arranger check out the arrangements he did for sinatra and jobim on their duo recording in the 60s i met several musicians on that band that took the time to show me things about all kinds of music rubens bassini former percussionist with brazil 66 took me under his wing and showed me many things about the rhythms of brazilduring that same year mintzer started playing with the tito puente orchestra this was a steady gig around the new york area this music had a lasting impact on mintzers writing and playing for years to come he later played with eddie palmieri and mongo santamariain 1975 mintzer joined the buddy rich big band and spent two and a half years playing every night with rich except for a week off at christmas time on buddys band mintzer explains we played in every small town in the us as well as in other countries i was so thrilled to be playing every night and seeing new places all the time we would go out after the concerts and find a place to sit in with a local band if there was no jazz club we would play with whatever band there was i remember playing with a cowboy band in el paso texas one night i also learned how to write big band arrangements on richs band he was very gracious about letting me write for his bandwhile with richs band mintzer also

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norm_Drucker>,Norm Drucker,norm drucker born july 4 1920 in new york city was a major influence in professional basketball officiating for over 35 years his nba and aba officiating career as both a referee and supervisor of officials spanned the careers of alltime pro basketball greats from george mikan bob cousy dolph schayes and bob pettit in the 1950s to wilt chamberlain jerry west elgin baylor and bill russell in the 1960s to julius erving rick barry bill bradley and walt frazier in the 1970s and to larry bird and magic johnson in the 1980she was hired as a referee by the national basketball association in 1953 by the early 60s he was regularly officiating two to four games in the nba finals each season in 1969 when the twoyear old american basketball association was raiding the nba for talent he took the risk along with three other nba lead referees joe gushue earl strom and john vanak and jumped to the financially uncertain aba their contracts were the first multiyear officiating contracts in pro basketball history such was druckers stature and reputation that his total salary as a referee and supervisor of officials along with a 25000 signing bonus was more than double the average nba players salary it made him at that time the highest paid referee in the history of basketball within a year all other pro basketball officials benefited as their salaries more than doubled as a result officiating professional basketball evolved from a parttime second job to a fulltime career with greatly improved working conditions benefits and pension plans it was the first time in history that a league had promoted the quality of its officials which improved the abas credibility and as a byproduct enhanced the publics interest in and respect for referees in the aba drucker officiated and also served as the leagues supervisor of officials with the abanba merger in 1976 drucker was one of only a handful of aba referees hired by the nba to return when he retired after the 197677 nba season to become the nbas supervisor of officials his 24 consecutive seasons of officiating was the longest string in pro basketball history it remains the record for longest tenure for a pro referee among those whose entire career was during the era of only two referees per game during that span he officiated 6 allstar games 3 nba 3 aba a higher total than any other official in pro basketball history other than mendy rudolph and earl strom both of whom officiated seven when he retired his total of 38 nba and aba championship round games officiated was the second highest in pro basketball historyin his 24year officiating career 17 in the nba and 7 in the aba drucker was well known for his evenhanded officiating for visiting teams in an era when many officials were criticized as homers favoring the home team in a 1969 interview with newsdays stan isaacs he said i think there is a part of me deep down that enjoys calling a foul against the home team and then standing out there alone almost defying the cries of the hometown mob for 14 seasons from 1963 through 1977 drucker along with mendy rudolph and earl strom were generally recognized as the top referees in pro basketballas a result assigning drucker to big games was commonplace and he officiated the deciding game of league championships eight timesfour times in the nba in 1963 1965 1966 and 1968 and four times in the aba in 1971 1972 1974 and 1976 of the nearly 400 referees who have officiated in the nba and aba only two others mendy rudolph and joe crawford have officiated in more deciding games with a reputation for making gutty calls and not protecting superstars he holds the distinction of being the only referee ever to eject wilt chamberlain from an nba game calling three technical fouls on chamberlain on january 3 1962in the late 1950s and early 1960s he was involved in what the press called a heated feud with legendary boston celtic coach red auerbach his second ejection of auerbach in a onemonth period led to the coachs 3game suspension by nba president maurice podoloff on november 13 1961druckers career gave him a courtside view of key moments of the nbas first 35 seasons he was the last active nba referee to have officiated in 195354the last season before the nba introduced the 24second clock that same season he was selected to officiate the only regularseason game in nba history that experimented with rims 12 feet rather than 10 feet off the ground he officiated the games when bob pettit scored his 15000th career point and wilt chamberlain scored his 25000thhe officiated the last game in the history of the abathe deciding game 6 of the 1976 aba championship series the deciding game of the 1963 nba finals bob cousys final game as a boston celtic and the deciding game of the 1966 finals red auerbachs last gamedrucker is also the link to referees whose careers span the entire history of the nba he partnered on the court with sid borgia and hall of fame referee pat kennedy whose nba careers started in the nbas first season 194647 and as the nbas supervisor of officials drucker hired joe crawford who was still officiating during the 201415 seasonat the end of his officiating career drucker demonstrated a commitment to improving the salary benefits and working conditions for future generations of professional referees in 1977 he along with 23 of the nbas 25 other referees went on strike before the playoffs at 56 years old and about to retire he noted at the time im not going to be the recipient of the benefits of a collective bargaining agreement i could have made a good deal for myself by not striking any one of the top 14 lead referees could have but if we went the bottom 14 referees wouldnt have any power the nba would tear the referees up after 16 days the strike was settled with the nba for the first time recognizing the referees union drucker worked what remained of the 1977 playoffs and retired within three years the salary and benefits for each top nba referee increased by 100000 per year as he predicted he shared in none of the improved salary and working conditions enjoyed by future generations of professional refereesdespite having picketed and engaged in media interviews during the strike to bring pressure on the nba within four months the nba hired him as its supervisor of officials overall drucker supervised and taught other referees for 10 seasons six in the nba two as a crew chief 19671969 and four as the nbas supervisor of officials 197781 and four as the abas supervisor of the officials 196973 his decade as a referee administrator had a substantial impact on nba playing rules and improving the quality of basketball officiatingas the nbas supervisor of officials he was one of the first nba executives to publicly advocate the adoption of the abas threepoint basket and the use of three referees per game the nba adopted the threepoint basket in 1979 and adopted the threeman officiating system for the 197879 season although the league returned to two officials the next season the threeofficial system returned in the 198889 season and has been used by the nba ever since as an administrator in the aba and nba he recruited andor trained young referees many of whom had long successful nba careers including joe

careeralso during druckers tenure as supervisor he instituted the first professionally administered psychological profiling for nba referees to evaluate what personality traits were most common among great referees among the findings said drucker was that to be a great referee youve got to love basketball to succeed at itafter his retirement as supervisor the nba honored him as an allstar referee in the first three nba legends games which showcased retired nba allstars in an oldtimers game during nba allstar weekends always a bit of a showman he hit allstar coach red auerbach with a technical

news the 24hour european television news station comcast newsmakers and several other television programsmorin commented on his cartoon work prior to the 2008 election the consensus among cartoonists is that caricature is created solely through exaggerating physical features relative to the appearance of the subject ive never agreed with this sliderule approach caricature is a visual commentary on what kind of man or woman that politician is just as important as physical appearance is how they sound what they say what they stand for their accomplishments or lack thereof and so on caricatures are not mere likenesses they are psychologicalportraits that stem from something deeper than human anatomycartoonists are always asked during an election how they like drawing candidates the better time to ask this question is four years after the election caricatures evolve over time the same way an administration does my george w bush drawings when he was running in 1999 are a far cry from what they are now with each scandal screwup flipflop and outrage he grew angrier meaner and very much smaller when gerald ford first took over the presidency cartoonists were whining about his dull physical appearance yet when ford tripped down the stairs of air force one at the same time proposing to fight against inflation with win buttons those caricatures of him started to gel really fast richard nixon say no more hes the perfect storm of personality policy and appearancehillary was and will be a great joy to draw she has always struck me as someone playing a leader as opposed to actually being one her speeches sound as if she is trying to be someone elsejfk roosevelt reagan bill or barack the phoniness is inescapable cartoonists focus on her rabbitlike front teeth but for me hillarys ruthless ambition can be seen in her piercing eyes the only downside of her her everchanging hairstyle drives caricaturists nutsmccain is fun to draw because we know him already to some extent the maverick independent thinker unpredictability volcanic temper goofiness bad jokes after having drawn him many times i once put a very long distance between the bottom of his nose and his mouth for some reason it worked it visually said john mccain that exaggeration makes no sense when you measure his facial features but it feels appropriate when you hear the sound of his voicebarack obama is problematic because we dont know him yet and therefore have little of substance to go on race by the way has nothing to do with it caricature is colorblind and everyone is treated with equal malice the more obama resorts to platitudes flipflops verbal bumbles and fumbles the more his caricature will evolve and stretch this current lack of familiarity is one reason why drawings of obama are now fairly literal with little exaggeration if he is elected that will change and it will be a change you can believe inmorin has only in recent years begun to show his paintings the coral springs

in that paper professor case constructed a crude repeat sales index to isolate appreciation from mix effects in measuring changes in house values the model presented in that paper showed that fundamentals explained only a small part of home price movements in the northeast between 1979 and 1985 the paper conjectured that the region had experienced a home price bubble in 1985 case met yale university economist robert shiller and they started out on a joint venture that would lead to over a dozen coauthored papers and essays the earliest work by case and shiller case and shiller 1987 1989 included a methodological paper detailing a more refined version of the repeat sales price index and their most cited work the efficiency of the market for single family homes which appeared in the american economic review in 1989 the latter paper presented weak form efficiency tests and found strong evidence of inertia in house prices it also showed that over the cycle simple decision rules would with near certainty bring excess profits this was the first empirical paper on housing bubbles in 1991 they started a firm called case shiller weiss inc with allan weiss who served as the ceo from inception to the fiserv sale they began producing the case shiller index on a regular basis now a well known and often cited index of house prices the indexes are available at the zip code level

case and shiller 1990 which presented strong form tests showing the housing market was forecastable in 1988 they responded to a booming housing market in california by developing a survey of the expectations and attitudes of homebuyers in four cities san francisco anaheim orange county ca milwaukee and boston the survey showed that home buyers were knowledgeable about current conditions they saw little or no risk in the housing market they had very positive price expectations they thought of housing as an investment and they indicated they would hold out in a down market in 2003 case and shiller redid the same survey and have repeated it every year since case shiller and weiss also wrote a series of articles which proposed the establishment of futures and options markets in real estate case shiller and weiss 1993case wrote several papers which described the consequences of housing price booms and busts for regional economies and the distribution of income and wealth case and cook 1989 case 19901991 and 1992 the debate continues about who anticipated the ultimate collapse of the housing market case and shiller were among the first to describe the risks they were writing about housing bubbles in regional markets in the mid 1980s the question they were investigating was how do housing price booms unwind do they gradually deflate or do they burst in 1999 professor case wrote a paper for the brookings panel entitled real estate and the macroeconomy the topic was suggested by william brainard of the brookings institution who was very worried about the risks posed by a house price bubble in that paper case wrote three concerns remain the absence of any way to fully diversify around or to hedge market risk the dramatic recent increase in the size and volume of the subprime market and a substantial exposure of the federal government to catastrophic risk by far the bulk of losses suffered by holders and insurers and guarantors of mortgage paper in the past have been due to regional declines in house prices case and shiller 1996 the simple fact is that delinquencies become defaults and losses only when collateral is insufficient to cover the debt the losses incurred in texas new england and california between 1985 and 1993 as the result of collateral shortfall dwarf the losses in the rest of the country due to changes in borrower economic circumstances in the current economic climate with home prices rising in every region of the country variations in borrower characteristics such as credit scores explain most of the variation in default and foreclosure if the housing market were to suffer a 20 percent decline default rates and losses would far exceed the losses forecast by the most sophisticated credit scoring models in the industry this

angeles child welfare authorities on november 4 1970in the first several years after genies early life and circumstances came to light psychologists linguists and other scientists focused a great deal of attention on genies case seeing in her neartotal isolation an opportunity to study many aspects of human development doctors monitored the way in which she interacted with her environment and other people as well as her receptivity and response to different psychological treatment methods tests on genies brain found persistent discrepancies far larger than any prior observations of people with fully intact brains giving rise to many new hypotheses on brain lateralization and its effect on both language and other cognitive processes upon finding that genie had not yet learned a language linguists saw genie as having the potential to be an important way to gain further insight into the processes controlling language acquisition skills and linguistic development they began to observe her use and comprehension of general american english and in may 1971 commenced a case study primarily focused on monitoring her language acquisition extensive observations of their newfound human subject enabled them to publish multiple academic works testing theories and hypotheses identifying critical periods during which humans learn to understand and use languagethroughout the time scientists studied genie she made substantial advances with her overall mental development within months of being discovered genie had developed exceptional nonverbal communication skills and her consistent ability to nonverbally express her emotions and desires was of great interest to the people who studied her she became much more willing to interact with other people and gradually developed some friendships and basic social skills however even by the time their case study ended she still had many behaviors characteristic of an unsocialized person she also continued to learn and use new language skills throughout the time they tested her although scientists noted that her linguistic development remained markedly different from previous observations of children acquiring a first language as the scientists worked with genie her progress considerably slowed and she ultimately remained unable to fully acquire a first language the vast disparity between her language and her nonverbal communication served as further evidence for what was then a relatively new proposition that they were not totally interconnectedafter being found genie was initially cared for at childrens hospital los angeles and her subsequent placements eventually gave rise to rancorous and protracted debate after living at the hospital until late june 1971 she was moved into the home of her teacher at the hospital for a month and a half upon removal from this home she was then placed with the family of the scientist heading the research team studying her where she lived for approximately four years and where the scientists conducted most of their testing and research on her in mid1975 soon after turning 18 she went back to live with her mother who could not adequately care for her after a few months genies mother then had her placed in the first of a series of institutions for disabled adults during the year and a half genie lived at this location she experienced further extreme physical and emotional abuse cut off from almost all of the people who had studied her her physical and mental health severely deteriorated and her newly acquired language and behavioral skills rapidly regressed upon her removal in april 1977 she spent two weeks recovering from her treatment at childrens hospital before returning to the foster care systemin early january 1978 genies mother suddenly decided to forbid all of the scientists except for one from having any contact with genie and all testing and scientific observations of her immediately ceased most of the scientists who studied and worked with genie have not seen her since this time the only post1977 updates on genie and her whereabouts are personal observations or secondary accounts of them and all are spaced several years apart throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s she moved through several additional abusive foster placements where her mental condition continued to decline but by early 1993 she was living in a more supportive living arrangement as of 2008 abc news reported that genie was living in california in psychological confinement as a ward of the stateher sixth foster home and again she is speechlessalthough no scientific analysis of genie has occurred since late 1977 psychologists and linguists have continued to write about genies case and development long after this time since the case study on genie concluded there has been considerable academic and media attention given to her life and the methods of the research team surrounding her this in turn has sparked an ethical debate about their treatment and has led to questions and disputes regarding whether she had reached the limits of her developmental potential in particular genies case has been extensively compared with that of victor of aveyron an eighteenthcentury french child who similarly became a classic case of late language acquisition and delayed development
