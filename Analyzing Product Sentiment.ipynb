      "Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09\n"

      "After reading endless reviews on this thing, I finally decided to dish out the money for this toy. Once I got it in the mail, I was already a little disappointed - it looks just like a rubber dog toy you buy from petsmart, squeaks like one too. I still wanted to try it out because I was desperate to find something to help alleviate my son's teething pain, but the dog was more interested than he was. It didn't seem to help him. I just wanted to share this for the moms on here who are willing to buy anything to help with their baby's teething pain. This isn't the toy. My son likes a cold pacifier, the silicone raspberry teether (costs only $4) or even the tip of his baby spoons better than this thing. It certainly shouldn't be amazon's #1 baby item.\n"

      "As every mom knows, you always want to give your children the best you can.  Though I thought it was a bit expensive, I had read many good reviews about the Vulli Sophie Giraffe Teether and wanted to get one for my baby girl.  And because Sophie is made from all natural rubber and decorated with food-grade coloring, I felt it would be worth the extra money to have the peace of mind knowing that there are no toxic paints, plastics, or dangerous small parts for my daughter to ingest.  She has had an easy time teething (she has 2 lower center teeth with 4 coming in on top and 2 more on the bottom), but she still likes to chew on her little Sophie Giraffe.  Sophie's long skinny neck and legs are easy for my daughter's small hands to hold.  My little girl loves to nibble on Sophie's ears, horns, and feet.  Plus, I think this little giraffe is just so cute.  Also, just as an anecdote: When I first offered Sophie to my daughter, she was NOT interested.  The squeak was a bit loud for her, and the natural rubber taste was different for her.  I thought I may have wasted $18.  However, over time, my daughter has really come to like Sophie.  She will smile and reach for Sophie when I offer it to her, and she seems to enjoy chewing on Sophie.  I am glad I bought this teether, and because it is gender neutral, I know I can use it in the future whether I have another girl or a boy.\n"
