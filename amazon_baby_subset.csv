Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,5,1
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,5,1

Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,4,1
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5,1
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",5,1
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I'm a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby's daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby's patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5,1
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.,5,1
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.,5,1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it's her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,5,1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they're missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",5,1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",4,1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,5,1
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,5,1
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!,5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it's the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5,1
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.,5,1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5,1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey.",5,1
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",This is exactly like the one I had when I was a kid. My son really enjoys it and it keeps him entertained.,5,1
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!",5,1
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.,5,1
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Well made and quite a few different textures.Toddler loved this book and Mom approved, too.Everyone was happy with this selection.",5,1
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity.",4,1
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I'm not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",4,1
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",5,1
Pooh Baby's First Tigger,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.,5,1
Pedella Wooden Push Toy,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It's something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",5,1
Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",4,1
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it's been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it's a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he's does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn't seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can't always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It's not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I'm holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn't vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",5,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,5,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that's it.  The Champ is definitely the best.,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Our daughter is 13 months old and we've been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it's a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won't drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn't seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it's empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn't completely trapped, but it's pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I wasn't sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn't trade it in for anything.,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I've had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I've had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn't open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one's excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven't seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It's so simple and user-friendly it's ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you're ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don't waste your money on anything else!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE's changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn't smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can't even crack this.",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby's room and would recommend this item.,4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn't have a smell.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the only diaper pail we've had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it's olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I'll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it's not!  I haven't even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol'd it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there's ever a smell in the nursery, it's from the dipaer's presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn't want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it's TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I'd do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I'd still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can't expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece's ""soy diapers"" don't seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.  I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don't need two hands for it!",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn't know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I'm sold!  There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you'll be fine!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was 'how'd we survive through the first baby without that can'.It's easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :),5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn't need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It's so much better then the diaper genie. No special bags necessary! Occasionally there are some bad odors but it's nothing that can't be fixed with some febreeze or lysol!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Hands down....get this diaper pail... The only reason I ever even need to empty it is when it cant hold anymore! NEVER smells..ever! I change mine about every 2 weeks, like I said, only because thats when it seems to fill. Dont bother w/ the cheapies, this one is IT! Seriously....trust me! The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say. This is perfection.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost 5 months now and love it. It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay. I would recommend hosing the inside with Lysol after each bag change.,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a friend that had the Diaper Genie and complained of it smelling on occasion.  My husband and I were a little leary of purchasing a diaper pail, but decided to give the Diaper Champ a try!  I am so glad that we did!  We have been using it for almost a month and it is great!  It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!  I would definetely recommend!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!  It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don't have to stock up on refill's or run to the store when you realize you don't have anymore.  There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Got this for my baby shower, after reading all the reviews.  I have never had a problem with mine.  I uses odor controlling garbage bags, and you never smell any dirty diapers.This product is great!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great for dirty Diapers. I have had no problem with smells. And it is easy to empty out. I love It!!!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old.  I thought that it was hard to use.  We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out.  The name say's it all.  Our son is now almost 2 years old.  We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash.  We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all.  It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail.  Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone.  NO refills to buy or anything.  ITs great.  ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag.  This is way better than the diaper genie!!",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like our diaper champ because you don't have to buy special bags and it let's you know when it's full.  We don't have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Daiper Champ is a true champion. Earlier i was planning to buy Diaper Genie as i had liked its innovative style. However, all my friends were sick and tired of its refill system. Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food. It also need some assembly while as CHAMP is so easy to use and can take any size diaper, any trash bag and even a kid can handle it with ease.",5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like this diaper pail.  I've had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don't know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.  As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don't personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It's easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don't expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn't), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that's ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can't go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he's older and doesn't go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don't have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it's extra large containment area you don't have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn't specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to ""try harder"", then call again if I couldn't get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it's your gamble.  I didn't take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.  On the bright side, I really haven't felt that it's gotten dirtier than a lysol wipe could handle- so despite that lack of helpfulness that the customer service folks could offer me, I would still recommend the product itself to a friend.",4,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am glad I bought this! It uses regular garbage bags and there is no odor at all. It is so easy to use. Thumbs up on this one. I am glad I didnt get the diaper genie..it wouldve been a waste of money!I recommend this diaper champ to everyone!,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This truly is the champ of diapers. This product, unlike the genie and others, is standalone of ""refills"" (well, you do need garbage bags, but you should already have those). It also does a very good job of keeping the stink away. Not once has the smell came out in such a way that we notice.It also kind of reminds me of the ghost jail thing in Ghostbusters, you know, where they put the trap in and release the ghosts?It's a great product. It's kind of big, it's well made, and it will not need to be changed out for about a week. I'd advise anyone to buy it.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Love this. We keep several layers on the crib mattress: mattress pad/protector, sheet, then ultimate crib sheet. In case of nighttime accidents or illness of any sort, I can just pull the ultimate crib sheet off, have another sheet ready to go, and mattress is always protected. Deducted one star b/c both of our ultimate crib sheets balled up immediately with first wash. Not as bad with second sheet since actually followed washing directions, but still had some pilling of soft layers.",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I don't know how I would have managed without these! My  twin boys wet through diapers like crazy, and these sheets are a huge time saver... just snap them out, wash & dry and snap them back on. They are really soft too.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased the Ultimate Crib Sheet for a baby gift. I'm that crazy about this product. Like all of my favorite baby items (my babies are now almost 10 and almost seven), the crib sheet was a gift from a friend who too, loved it. You put your regular crib sheet down on the bed (the fitted one). This one snaps in over the fitted sheet, around the rungs of the crib. If your child poops/pees/vomits in the middle of the night, all you have to do is unsnap the top sheet (it's got a leak proof backing on it) and then you've already got your regular sheet underneath, ready to go. No fighting with the mattress in the middle of the night. Getting a fitted sheet on the mattress is hard enough during the day; doing it when your child has other issues going on is a nightmare. This really is the ""Ultimate"".",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have loved having these crib sheets!  I only have to use one regular sheet, and then this goes over the top.  When it needs to be changed, a few snaps does the trick and off it comes.  Otherwise I'd have to have a mattress pad, a waterproof pad, and a regular sheet, and all three would have to come off for each change.  With the thick mattress on the crib, changing them would be a real chore.  The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves time and money.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product was exactly what I needed. I could not find one locally & my only choice was to drive to another, larger town.",4,1

"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I received 2 of these sheets as a gift after my daughter was born.  I already had several sheets and didn't think I would use these...then I tried them.  I can't say enough great things about this product.  It is so easy to change the bedding now.  No more lifting up that huge mattress.  Make sure and have 2 of them-so that you can have one clean at all times.  It takes me less than 3 minutes to change the sheets.,5,1
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,I was looking for a nightime waterproof pad for an elderly person.  After looking through what Amazon offered I choose this one and have been pleased with it.  It does a terrific job in absorbing and keeping the bed dry.  It is also very soft and comfortable.Its not as large as the picture would indicate.  Take the measurements given seriously.This is an excellent value.  Recommended.,5,1

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","It does the job of protecting the mattress, the flaps for tucking under the bed come out a lot though. Not sure if it's worth the hassle of having them.  My daughter tends to be a wiggle worm though.  I suppose without them the pad might not be remotely in the right spot in the morning though. We bought two for a twin bed since she is all over the bed during the course of an evening and I wanted to make sure we were covered. 1 would work for a toddler/crib sized mattress, if you have a twin you will probably want 2.",4,1
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","This works great and covers plenty of space around my daughter's diaper area.  Easy to wash.  My only complaint is that the side near the wall keeps sliding out (presumably because I'm not tucking it in just right).  In time I'm sure I'll figure out the best way to do it, but for now I have to fix it every couple days.  Not a big deal. :)",4,1
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","Washes well and is wider than the other brand mattress protector I have so it tucks in better on the sides (and this one is cheaper!)  It does seem to have less padding/cushioning than the other but absorbs just as well and doesn't leak. It has a nice smooth sheet feel to the top of it, while our other has a soft fuzzy feel to the top. My 5 year old son doesn't seem to have a preference.",5,1

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",Works great!! Stays in place on the bed. Never had a leak. Makes night training my twins so much easier.,5,1
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",Love this thing.. what a bed saver... I was finishing potty training my 2 year old and bed time was my biggest concern.  But with this I do not have to worry about the foam mattress I have on my daughters bed.  It is easy to wash and put back on the bed.. love this thing.,5,1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn't at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won't go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!",4,1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"My 1 yr old is very clever, but he can not work out how to open these, they have been a life saver - literally!!!!",4,1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to. I'm not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them...they are hard enough for adults to disconnect! I wasn't sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product (seems to be hit or miss with this company), but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers. And the price is great for a 2-pack.",5,1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,Almost impossible to open for installation and to use once installed. Good because Im 99.9% sure my little one will never get hurt but my hands hurt now. A few swear words needed to remain mentally sound during install process lol,4,1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,This thing works but it's very tricky getting off. If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off. Don't get discouraged like I did. Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure. Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp.,5,1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"We have two power strip covers at our house--one by safety 1st and the other by Mommy's Helper.  The Safety 1st cover far exceeds the quality and durability of the Mommy's Helper cover (whose buckles looked like they might break if opened too often.)  I like the Safety 1st cover because it allows for adjustability in length and is very wide inside, as well as looking quite sturdy.  There was plenty of width inside ours as well, so I'm no sure what other reviews were referring to.  For extra safety, we covered the unused sockets on the strip with plugs...wish I had purchased this one first!",5,1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I bought one of these to see if it would fit over an extra-long power strip. The product description wasn't entirely clear, and it turns out that the description is at the small side. Sliding the case, it can cover larger power strips.It's also remarkably child-proof. Our household has an 8-month-old who's getting into everything. While she's usually blocked from getting to the computer desks, it's smart to err on the side of caution and protect every power strip in the house.I'm very pleased with this product and will order more, now that I see how versatile, sturdy, and safe they are.",4,1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I like this and will probably order another one, but I had to switch out the power strip I wanted to originally use it for because the strip was too long. So, other than that it is great.",4,1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I got this for my son's room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside (for example for the wipes warmer).  If you are plugging in standard sizes only, it should work great.  We ended up not using it.",4,1
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,This fold up booster seat is great. I noticed some people complained about the cracks holding food but we just take it apart and put it in the dishwasher like the directions say (only problem is springs in the tray rust). We also occasionally using it on the floor to when our son wants to draw (rub crayongs on paper).,5,1
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"After trying 2 other monitors, this one is wonderful.  It gets great reception inside and out (I can get some yard work done!).  I have a 2-story house with a basement and get reception on all 3 levels.  Excellent product!",5,1
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I saw this while browsing and decided to get it on a whim, and I am so pleased with it. It is very nice to take into restaurants and you KNOW your highchair is clean. It puts them at your level and they feel part of the family. I love that it has a tray so again, sanitary eating surface. The plastic is easy to wipe down, but we haven't had any big messes to clean from the crevices, so I can't complain about that yet. It feels very secure once attached and the only thing to watch is that the table won't tip from the unbalanced weight. Two things I wish were easier, first, depending on the table thickness, we sometimes have to put the chair part-way on and put our daughter in before securing it tightly to the table, so it really takes 2 of us to do it safely. She just can't maneuver into the seat otherwise. And second, it is a bit bulky even though it folds almost flat. It folds to about 12&quot;x24&quot; (I am guessing, don't quote that) but we just leave it in the cargo area of the SUV and it's not bad. Really is a hassle when carrying the baby, diaper bag, and this seat at the same time, so I use it only when I have someone to help me. Once in place, it has been a wonderful purchase! Well worth the effort!",5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I saw a few negative reviews on these locks that made me hesitant to purchase them, but when my 18 month old son came in the living room holding the freeze off wart can, that was it! They have such little arms and fingers; he reached right under the sink that had the traditional plastic child proof locks. I bought the 2 pack to try it and was so very careful because as some of the reviews said, you can drill right on through the cabinet and that is quite true, I almost did it on the first one I did. I blame my husband for distracting me, but I was holding the drill. Take it slow and BE CAREFUL! Consider turning the speed of your drill down so it doesn't get away on you. It's worth it, and as long as you use the little magnet extenders they give you, it will work awesome! As for being tricky, yes you have to read the directions. The first one took me about 30 minutes to figure out, but then it was easy! I ordered more and I just now put 2 more on, in about 10 minutes and they work super! If you need extra keys like we did, consider buy another couple of 2 packs, you pay $7.99 for an extra key and only get the key. For 3 bucks more you can get 2 more locks and the key and put them maybe in the kitchen where you have more cabinets. Just stick the key on the fridge, high up away from little fingers and you always know where it is! I'm very impressed with this safety lock system and won't use anything else.",5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"This is a wonderful product!  I tried several brands of the traditional plastic cupboard toddler locks and they kept breaking or the cupboard could still be pulled open.  Tot lok is strong and unopenable without the key.  Plus, it does not compromise the look of my cupboards either.  The instructions are easy to follow for proper installation.  I can't say enough about this great product!  Highly reccommended!",5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"We tried the tab and hook kind, where you push down the tab to disengage it from the hook, but those still allow your kid (and you) to get your finger smashed in the drawer, and kids figure them out pretty quick. Even the small gap needed to get your finger in to depress the tab is like a mile wide gap for small hands.  Installing them is a bear, with lots of trial and error, and usually no templates to help you. They also tend to collect grime, and they break or loosen up a lot over time.These are great!  The doors/drawers remain firmly shut until the magnetic lock is disengaged with the ""key"".  The directions are good, and they include a sticky template for each lock.  I will say that you need to read the instructions and make sure how your hardware is supposed to be lined up. I screwed up the first one I ever did, which was more me hurrying and screwing up some spacial relations as far as what direction things needed to be in than bad instructions.  After that the rest (we have quite a few of these installed) went smoothly.The sticky templates are especially helpful making sure everything is where it's supposed to be. If you have thick doors (we have really thick, hardwood cabinet doors) they have extender slugs that effectively lengthen the magnetic catch.  Even if you have to have a handyman install these they're well worth it!One note: It does take some trial and error to get the hang of what spot you have to pass the ""key"" over to disengage the lock. But you get the hang of it quickly.",5,1
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"My wife is one of the """"little"""" people.This is more confortable than other alternitives.",5,1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This is a very nice product, and does exactly what you'd expect it to do. My only two gripes are: (1) It's true that the first one is hard to install. The instructions are a bit hard to follow, and I think an adhesive version would be a big seller. (2) The extra kets are expensive. Otherwise, I really, really like the product. It's exactly what I was looking for, completely invisible, and my child can't possibly defeat this unless we leave the key within reach. Buy an extra key with the kit or you won't be able to get in either if and when you lose the enclosed key. A regular refrigerator magnet will NOT work as a emergency back up key.",4,1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"We tried Safety 1st's alternative cabinet lock, the kind you press down with your fingers just inside the cabinet door, as well as Tot Lok. We put some of each system on various cabinets in the kitchen. Tot Lok is vastly superior to the other kind. It works every time instead just most of the time; it makes it impossible for our 18-month-old to smash her fingers in the drawers and cabinets; it is strong and secure.",5,1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,This product is very easy to install and is the best of all child safety locks.  It's magnetic system is easy for parents but impossible for kids. =),5,1
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"This nail cutter originally came to us in a baby-care gift set when my first daughter was born. We've used it for her and my son for about 5 years. Upon moving to Boston, it was discovered missing and I tried several others, assuming there wouldn't be much difference. How wrong was I? I finally just ordered this again through Amazon and am very pleased yet again and so is my little 3 month old.",5,1
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"Clipping baby nails is one of the most stressful things. This nail clipper is small, but handles very well and the thicker handles make it an easier process. Well-made... we have been using ours for over 2 years without problems.",5,1
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this ""pacifier"", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.",4,1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub was an excellent purchase for our family. It folds up easily and neatly for a quick trip to grandma's house or for storage.One thing I recommend is purchasing a baby contoured body sponge to lay inside the tub as the lining is neither soft nor slip proof (a thick towel would also do the job). We have one and it makes the entire bathing experience a joy as we don't have to worry about holding our son is a safe position while we bathe him. The tub folds and unfolds easily and has no problems leaking. We live a California so we don't worry about the tub not being deep enough to allow the water to cover our baby completely, but if you lived in a colder area I might think about purchasing another tub that can keep your baby covered by more warm water.",5,1
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"This is a wonderful way for your boy or girl to stay clean and comfortable using the potty when away from home.  It is foldable which makes it easy to carry in a purse; it is comfortable and stable on the toilet which reinforces the child that it is safe to sit freely.  Don't be worried about catching your child's skin on the fold ends, it does not.  A convenient plastic zipper bag is sold with it too.  Enjoy!",5,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love this tub.  I think it was a great idea.  This works as a wonderful transition from a baby tub to the adult tub.  I bought it when my son was starting to sit, I didn't have to worry about a bath seats suctions not working and my son tipping over. Also I know it is hard to get older babies in and out of a regular bath seat without scraping knees. This bath seats clips on so I put him in the bathtub first, then just clip the seat on around him.  He can sit in the tub and play with his toys keeping everything within arms reach of him.  Its much better than filling an entire tub for such a little person.  It does leak a little, but I just put it in our tub so it doesn't matter.  This is a good idea anyway to get them used to the adult tub for when they do eventually have to use it.  I am not sure I would want it for a small infant.  I never used the sling/hammock thing.",5,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I think the 4-in-1 bathtub is the greatest. I originally put it on my registry because it looked good but I am happy to say it works wonderfully. I love the insert that allows the baby to lay back and still have easy access to wash his back. I also like the fact that it changes as your baby changes. The only drawback is that the place where you put the ring for the bath seat is a little difficult to clean, but cotton swabs work great. This is trully a must have for new moms.",4,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I went through 3 bathtubs before finding this wonderful tub. It features 4 bathing options,4 suction tabs, and a drain plug. Most infant baths I came accross are chair shaped. I found that my daughter could not get fully immersed in the water and splash in these chair-shaped baths. The 4-in-1 Bath Station By Safety 1st is shaped like an ordinary basin and has 2 options for how the baby sits in it. It is deep enough for my daughter to experience floating and kicking sensations which she absolutely loves. As a tiny infant, I would lay her on the soft slope and hold her so that her body was mostly covered. She would kick her legs and let them float. Of course, you cannot take you hands off the baby while she is lying like this, but that's not a bad thing in that it keeps you right there and vigilant!Now that she is nearly 7 months old she sits up in the ring at the one end. The ring goes accross her middle and between her legs. This was absolutely magical for her. I cannot emphasize how much she loved it; leaning forward and reaching for her plastic bath toys and kicking her legs and arms up and down. She also learnt to hold onto the rail in front of her for balance. While you should never leave the room when bathing a baby; with the rail in this bath, you can take your hands off the baby and watch happily as she plays for as long as you will let her. She cannot fall backward or forward, and nor can she get her head under water.The bath also folds up. The two halves slide together so that it is half the size. I don't often do this though I can see that it would be useful! However because of the join in the middle of the bath, the two sides are different depths. This is no problem - only, I wish the deeper side were the side where the older baby sits in the ring, and the shallower side were the side you would put the slope for newborns. Not a big deal, just a suggestion!There is one downside is that once the bath is full, you cannot move it. If you do try to slide it forward or backward, all the water leaks out of it! So once it is filled, best to leave it where it is!I highly recommend this product which you can use for many many months right from birth. The best part of it is that its fun and this summer I'm going to take it outside and use it as a splash pool that she can sit up by herself in!",4,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"After buying the first years 4 stage bath tub and hating it..I bought this one. Although I have not used the newborn stage yet, my daughter loves sitting up in this tub. In turn, she loves bath time. I like that she is secure sitting up because of the bath ring. My tub does not leak and I like that it elongates to fit my growing baby. I think this turned out to be a good buy..so far.",4,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,My daughter is 7 months old and I've used this tub since she was born. I really like it and it hasn't leaked on me. If you expand it correctly then you probably won't have leaks either. Collapsing and expanding it does take a couple of minutes but it's not impossible. I just leave mine expanded but I don't have other children so it's not in my way. At first I used it on the bathroom counter top and the suction cups on the bottom stuck great. So well in fact that I would really have to pull on them to get them off. But at least I knew it wasn't going to move. Now I use it in the regular bathtub because my daughter sits up and likes to splash. And it's big enough to have a bunch of toys in it with her. My daughter loves her baths and I like not having to fill up the regular bathtub with more water than I need. It also has plenty of room for growth so you'll probably be able to use it for awhile. I would definitely recommend this tub if you have the room for it.,4,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We had gotten this tub as a gift from the inlaws.  I did read the reviews at that time and most had been poor reviews, however we tried it anyway.  We love the tub!  Some of the reviews had complained that the tub leaked but as long as you follow the instructions there is no problem.  My son is now six months old and we have used this tub since he came home from the hospital.  The sling was wonderful and now he is old enough to sit up in the tub.  He just loves it.",5,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought that this tub was great and got lots of use out of it.  I never had any problems with it leaking. I did use it both on the counter and in the tub, though I preferred to just put it in the regular bathtub because it was easier to fill up.  If you properly put it together and hear the ""snap"", it won't leak, and I like the suction cups on the bottom.  At first I thought that the sling would somehow snap in and I found it a little confusing, then I just draped it over the side and that worked for me and I suppose that's how it's meant to be used.  I have used the one piece tubs and I found them awkward and difficult to use.  I like how the sling in this one gave a little (not like those hard tubs with the cheap foam pads) and put him at a slight angle and more in the water.  I had a large baby (both in hieght and weight) and never had any size issues with this tub.  I eventually just bought the regular tub seat that hooks onto the side of the tub because although it's still big, it was easier to find a place to store it.",4,1
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"My 8mo.old would not ride in a shopping cart, I found this item on a friends gift registry and bought it for myself.. Turned out to be the best money Ive spent in awhile.. My son rides without any problems now. Thank you thank you thank you......",5,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I wanted something that I could put my daughter in and she could crawl around safely.  The playpen was too small and she needed more room to explore.  I bought the extension kit immediately to make it seem even more bigger and she hardly even realizes it's an enclosure.  She has taught herself within a week how to stand up on her own and loves that she can still see everything that is going on around her.  I think it will be useful as she grows - even when we can use it to block off things such as the fireplace and Christmas tree...  It is easy to set up and can even fold up if you wanted to bring it to the beach, picnic, family gathering, etc.  It's made of a hard plastic that can easily be rinsed off.  I love it and am extremely happy with this play yard and more importantly my daughter is!!",5,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought this for my home and office, since my 10 month old grandson visits 2x a week.  It is wonderful, the only caution is that when you add additional extensions (we joined 1.5 superyards together)(and you will most likely need to, as it is not bigger enough without them) it is not as sturdy, so something to support it is necessary (put up against a wall or an ottoman on the outside to brace).  Also, the only criticism I have is that it is difficult to disconnect when entering or exiting the play area. Overall, however, I am very pleased with it.",4,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"The Superyard XT is a wonderful product for babies who have outgrown their bouncers/swings, etc.  Once babies start to sit up and discover that they can crawl they don't want to be confined and this allows them to explore and play in a safe environment. It is rigid enough for the babies to play in and great for when they pull-up and ""cruise"" around.  I am astonished at the very few negative reviews of this product.  I have twin boys who are delighted every time we go into the Superyard.  It allows us all to play(one average sized adult and two 10 month old boys fit just fine with room to spare without extensions)safely.  I would recommend attaching link-a-doos to the gate as this gives them something to play with as well.  Run to the store DO NOT WALK for this product.  A definate must for mobile babies.  Enjoy!!!  Plus it gives mom and dad a few minutes to breathe.....Hope this review helps.",5,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this gate to take apart and use it as a way to trap my puppy in the kitchen and off the furniture. It is easy to lift and move around. I also take it outside and use it for what is intended for--keeping the kids safe in the yard!! Great piece of equipement.,5,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought the same exact item from a pet store for 2x the price.  The company markets the item as the Petyard XT and it is the SAME EXACT ITEM!!!  Luckily my girlfriend, who has a baby, told me about the superyard.  I have linked my $100 petyard with my $50 superyard (they fit exactly) and my new puppy has a large safe play area.  I would definitely recommend this item to any puppy owner!",5,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I absolutely LOVE the Superyard!  It has many different uses, very versatile and we have used it inside and outside.  The fact that you can buy extension kits makes it even more useful.  We have a very active 17 month old who is content to play in the superyard with her toys, and I get in there with her to play.  She has lots of freedom to walk around and I don't have to chase her all day.I agree with the other reviews that of course you have to use common sense.  We have little trouble folding it up-and we have already added an extension kit to make it bigger.  It's great to take places--way better than lots of different gates all over the house!We will definitely use this one for our next one --and will probably be adding more extension kits to it!I don't mind the holes, and when kids have shoes on you don't have to worry about them putting their toes in the holes and trying to climb.  Just don't put big things in there that they can stand on and try to climb--again, common sense.I love it!",5,1
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"If you buy the Superyard XT, buy this.  Without it, the yard is too small.  It's a GREAT, sturdy product, well worth the extra couple bucks!",5,1
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I can't say enough good things about this product.  I have a very open floor plan so it was impossible to block areas off for my toddler.  I always felt guilty when I had to clean or do anything that would take me away because he would cry from being confined to the play yard, but now he has space to roam in and I can go about my daily routine knowing that he is in a safe environment and is happy to have all that space.  I don't feel as though I am confining my child anymore, just keeping him safe. He has a large area to play in and I am able to get other things done and give my older child some undivided attention.  I have thought about buying another superyard XT and doubling his play area, but I will give this extention kit a shot first.  I can't wait until summer to take him out I have an umbrella and stand that I think will work great to keep him shaded but allow him time outdoors.  If there is a babys r us in your area buy it there it will save you quite a bit on shipping.",5,1
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I just had to review this great product!  We bought the superyard when my youngest son was 6 months old (he's now 2 1/2).  It worked GREAT with him but it has had much more use also!  I used it about a year ago for my two Golden Retrievers when they were puppies to keep them from destroying my house when inside and to contain them when outside since we live on 5 acres with no fence.  And now, I'm using it for our latest animal addition, a 2 month old Dutch bunny -- it's great to use inside or outside with it also.  I'm getting either the extension or another superyard to give him more room since he will be using it for a long time hopefully.  Just thought I'd let everyone know how very useful this item is!!",5,1
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"I brought this as a gift for a friend's son because he loves the Thomas character. It seems to be a pretty nice purchase.

Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"Very nice 3 piece set.  Pictures on each piece are very detailed and nicer quality than most childs sets.  I would buy again but due to the high quality, I don't think I will need to.  It recommends washing on top rack of dishwasher.",5,1

Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,"With city sounds, animal sounds, orchestra and vocal doing the ""La Donna e Mobile"" who would think that a 2-year old would prefer the man's singing?  Indeed, she also enjoys the chuckle immensely, but when I put the entire song on the stereo for her, she was thrilled.  She still asks frequently for the ""man singing"" -- over her Sesame street songs and other children's music.  We love this toy and this is probably the cartridge we use the most, with Jazz being our second favorite.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I was looking for a ~$20 gift for a co-workers kid's first birthday and this looked highly rated.I gave it to the co-worker on a Friday to take to the party on Saturday and told him to let me know how it goes.  On Monday he said his son enjoyed it so far and the noises aren't super annoying or repetitive so it shouldn't drive him crazy any time soon.This seems like a very safe gift to give someone if you aren't sure what they are interested in.Recommended.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I got it based on reviews and I am glad I did.  My now-7-month-old son likes it though not as much as another musical toy.  The only downside of this toy as far as I can see - which was also pointed out by other reviewers - is that sound is very unnatural - I was surprised even though I was expecting it.  Think of an old cell phone with musical ringer.,4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"While this is a noise-making toy, it is a pleasure to hear. I play with it almost as much as my children. It is a lot of fun to hear the different pieces, and to hear how the different instruments blend in or are removed at the touch of a button. It is sturdy and holds up very well to the abuses of a toddler.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The Mozart Magic Cube was given to my infant daughter as a Christmas gift--she loves it! Perfect for little hands as they are learning coordination and motor skills.  It is fun to listen to the songs and isolate the different instruments or add them back in, one by one.  The rubber sides are durable, especially if dropped.  Nice, also, to have no sharp edges on it, so it is very safe.  My 11 month old niece was over to play and she discovered the cube and was enchanted by it.  I will be giving her one for her very own for her upcoming birthday!  As for the loudness level, I  don't find it terribly loud; however, I recognize it needs to be at a certain level in order for babies to focus in on it (if it were softer, they might not pay attention to it).",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my granddaughter loves this, seems to really understand the different functions of the different buttons. the sounds are different from each button and are pleasing alone or in combination with other buttons.  i gave this to her when she was six months old, and she is now quite proficient with all the buttons at age eight months.  the sound is not annoying, either, as some of the sounds of toys are.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toys plays beautiful classical music.  The child can choose which instruments to have playing or can use the entire orchestra.  It is pretty entertaining for the adults also :)  Much nicer also than many noisy toys.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I'm really not sure why so many people writing the review for this product are a.) being incredibly elitist about it vs. the older product by Embryonics that no longer exists and b.) complaining about the sound quality.Perhaps some of these parents expected the toy to be extremely loud and obnoxious like some Tickle Me Elmo doll, but I personally don't have a problem with the sound quality. Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn't be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn't bad at all for what it is.This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn't have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don't sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn't let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it's really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn't seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.",4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a must for any baby. My son is 1 year old and loves all the different music and instruments. It's also easy for your little one to push the big buttons.  The only thing I don't like about this product is that there is no volume control.  Other than that it's a good solid toy.,4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY THEN 1 YEAR DAUGHTER WHOS NOW 18 MONTHS BECAUSE SHE SAW IT IN A STORE AND REFUSED TO LET IT GO BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT 20 BUCKS WELL SPENT ONCE OUT OF THE STORE SHE HAS NOT PARTED FROM IT SINCE UNTIL SHE DROPPED IT FROM HER HIGH CHAIR AND WE THOUGHT IT BROKE BUT I REMOVED THE BATTERIES CLEANED IT WITH ALCOHOL AND ITS BRAND NEW AND SHE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THIS TOY IS AMAZING AND SHE LOVES HEARING THE SONG IN DIFFERENT WAYS ESPECIALLY THE ORCHESTRA ITS LIKE HER SECURITY BLANKET JUS A TOY INSTEAD. THIS TOY IS VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED I WILL BE BUYING THE SING ALONG I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY 8 MONTH OLD NEPHEW AND HE LOVES IT,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son got this for his first birthday and he hasn't stopped playing with it.  He loves the music and has started dancing to all the songs.  If the cube is out of reach he will even point at it and start dancing.  It was so easy for him to figure out.  He carries it around room to room so that it always nearby for music.  He has thrown it several times and it was not damaged. I am going to start buying this toy as a gift for other babies and toddlers because I am positive they would enjoy it also.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,this was just as advertised.  Perfect forlittle fingers.  Quite nice toy withlovely sound quality and bright colorsand flashing lights.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 11 month old grandson loved this toy -- dances to it with smiles all over.  His big brother (9) wants to play with it too, having a greater understanding of the instruments.  Their dad, 39, liked the option of adding or subtracting instruments from the mix.  Good tunes, good fun.",4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.",4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son loves to dance to music now. He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit. He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Like it very much, also very suitable for me, will come again next time, have a preferential activities to inform me.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,the music is very lovely.i also love this music box and my daughter is also.you can hear the 8 song. the mozart.and you can play a 5 music instrument.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter received this for her first birthday.  She absolutely loves it.  She's 16 months old now, and it has become her favorite toy.  She will climb into her toy box, over all her other stuff, to get to it.  It keeps her busy for a good 20 minutes at a time while she experiments with all the different songs and musical instrument sounds.  We still haven't had to replace the batteries, which is a definite plus!",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our son 5 month old son loves things that light up and play music, which is why we bought this for him. He likes to look at it, but hasn't figured out how to push the buttons on his own yet. The buttons are sensitive, so they will be easy for him to push once he figures it out. Overall, this is a pretty cool toy.",4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is one of my favorite infant gifts! It plays wonderful classical pieces. The sides are easy for infants to activate. Each side flashes as that instrument plays to keep their attention. Good for infant to age 5 at least!,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son LOVES this toy.  He will be playing with other toys, walk over to the cube turn on some music and then go back to his toys. He will do this almost all day long.  He loves playing with it as well.  We bought it when he was 1 year old and he has been playing with it ever since (16 mos now).  And another good point is that the sound quality of the music is good enough for a parent's ears as well.  Buy this toy.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We received this toy as a gift for our baby. Haven't used it yet but we had the same trouble with the packaging as everyone else! Pliers work.,4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our seven-month-old twins love this. They are still too young to understand the functionality of adding and subtracting instruments, but they are fascinated by the sounds and babble happily along with them. Plus, the tunes are actual Mozart melodies and considerably less annoying for adults than the bleeps of many other ""musical"" toys. If anyone at Munchkin is reading this review, we would love a Bach Cube for variety!",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We absolutely LOVE this cube! I bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can't quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. Anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! The sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any ""instrument"", it is not boring. I do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. Great product!",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our first son received this toy for his first B-Day from his Great-Grand Parents.  He played with it almost daily, and now three years later his younger brother plays with it.  It's not annoying like many toys can be as the music is soft and relaxing. LOVE IT! Would for sure buy again if needed.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our babies enjoy this music cube. They didn't take long to start pounding on it.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,He loved it.  Hopefully when he is a little older he'll listen to each part completely instead of going to the next button!!!,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I love this Magic Cube.  It was a gift from a friend, and is a fantastic toy.  The musical selection is good, the quality of the tones is also quite good.  It is the first interactive toy my four month old baby figured out how to use, though he tends to hit the sides with his feet rather than his hands.  You won't regret this one!",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter has been playing with this toy for a year and a half, and loves it still.  It is the least annoying musical toy we own.  The music is pretty, the quality of the sound is quite good, and you can listen to it for 2 years without wanting to pull your hair out.  She has long since understood the difference in musical instruments and can recognize the individual sounds of instruments in the music we hear throughout the day.  ""Listen Mommy, a french horn!""",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 22-month-old twins luuuuuuuuuvvv this little Mozart cube (one of them in particular -- he tries to take it everywhere he goes!). Unfortunately there is no button to lower the sound, as there is on many musical toys, but it is Mozart, so it isn't grating to adult ears. This is a terrific toy and I'm sure it's good for my little guys to be listening to world-class music. However, the toy itself is not very durable, in my opinion. We've only had it three weeks, and already the sound has stopped playing (though the lights still light up). My little nephew has one of these cubes as well, and his mom pointed out that although his still works, the plastic cover has cracked, causing them to wrap it in plastic tape so that it would not fall apart. I am buying a second one for my boys because they adore it -- but if this one dies too, that's it. No more cubes at twenty bucks a pop.",4,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our toddler has what we call a &#34;jukebox&#34; tendency- he sort of uses any musical toys as background music while doing other activities. Most musical toys became quickly grating to our ears so we invested in this highly rated toy. Well, he LOVES it and the sound quality of this toy is good enough where you as an adult can appreciate the Mozart melodies. He plays with this several times a day, every day so as far as we're concerned it was a great investment.",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this for our granddaughter before she was a year old.  She just batted at the cube to make music.  She is now two and a half; she has progressed from random punching of the different sides (""directing"" the orchestra as she went), to adding and subtracting instruments and changing the song. She's danced to it, sung with it, and dropped it several times.  We have never had to change the battery, not has it ever slipped up in its performance.  This is the greatest toy she owns; learning to love Mozart is a wonderful bonus for this piano-teacher grandma.  Now I'm buying one for my newest nephew.",5,1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My two year old had regressed to not wanting to use the potty. So I got this because she LOVES spongebob. Worked like a charm, now I hear all day I poop on Bob lol. If your kid likes Spongebob and you have having potty training issues, I can't promise anything but it cleared it right up for me :)",4,1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house. Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty. He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool (Thomas the Train logo on step stool).,5,1
Baby Drum Musical Toy,Got this about a month ago for my 7 month old son.  He takes his sticks and beats on this thing forever.  We LOVE it!,5,1
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"For my 8 month old grandson who likes to bang on thngs. Put the sticks away till hes older, they went right in the mouth.",5,1
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"It's basic, it's simple, it's a drum.  Well constructed and can handle being tossed across the room by it's rambunctious 1 yr old owner.  If your child likes to make noise and bang on things like glass doors, give him this drum.  We also had to teach our son not to walk and run while chewing on the end of the drumstick.  It almost became a favorite teething toy.",5,1
Baby Drum Musical Toy,My son is 8 months and we've had this since he was Z months. My son loves this drum! He sits on the floor right beside it and wildly bangs either one or both drumsticks (included with drum) on its surface. Both sides of the drum are able to be used. The surface does get scratched pretty easily but it still sounds the same.,4,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I just got 2 of these (top and bottom of the stairs) and think they are great. The most common complaint other reviewers have is that the bottom pops out. I think I know why:There are rectangular steel boxes for the top and the bottom latch ends of the gate. The box for the bottom is deeper than the one for the top. If you install the shallow box on the bottom and the deep box on the top, then the bottom of the gate will pop out easily. When the boxes are correct, the bottom is held securely.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We've had our gate for almost 5 years on the top of our stairs and it works beautifully. After installation my husband noticed that if pushed it would pop out on the bottom as our house is older and the walls are uneven.  He solved the problem easily by installing a small door stop on the other side of the gate bottom so the bottom of the gate slides between the metal bracket and the door stop.As others mentioned it is easy to remove (sans hardware) and reinstall.  My kids are 3 and 4 so we only need the gate at night.  Each morning I pop it off and store it away.  Even when it's on it doesn't look that bad, in fact I think it's one of the nicer gates I've seen.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This baby gate is AWESOME!!! It is so easy to install and its function is flawless. The fact that it both swings and slides makes it so versatile as to where it can be placed. It is so strong my 2 year old will climb up onto it and shake it violently and it has stood up to these conditions for over a year!!! This is a home run as far as baby gates go, it is great for both the top and bottom of stairs, too. A++.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,This is a very simple and sturdy gate. Very easy to use one handed. We put the second one at the door to our child's room. It's easy to be quiet shutting this gate.  I've recommended this gate to my friends already.,5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I purchased this for the top of a stair way. I love it. Installation was easy. Opening and closing is so easy (even my 6 year old and 11 year old have no trouble). For the cost, it is a very sturdy and excellent gate.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,The gate took about 15 minutes to install. It is very sturdy and looks nice.,4,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have not had a problem with the bottom popping out like another poster mentioned. I wonder if the wall was slightly wider at the bottom from the house settling.  I am very happy with it, though one word of caution.  We noticed that the holes on the template don't line up with the ones on the gate, so you might as well chuck the template and go it alone.  We have a few extra holes in the wall because of it.  I love the fact that you can take it right off the wall when not in use, without having to mess around with the hardware.",4,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought a few of these gates after our son began to climb the other gates we had. These wooden gates are a bit more expensive but are well worth the price. They are easy to install, heavy duty, better looking and vitually impossible to climb over. We feel much saver with them on the stairs.  Our previous gates were made of plastic and were the type with the large &quot;holes&quot; in them. When our son began to pull up to standing we noticed the plastic gates swayed and twisted a bit. A few weeks later he figured out how to get his little feet in the holes and climbed to the top of the gate. Spend the little extra to get a gate that will last and will keep your climber safe.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,We have 4 of these gates and love them.  It is SO easy to install and SO super easy to use!  I had a professional baby proofer come to my house and he saw my gates and said this was the gate he recommends as well.  I can open and close it with one hand - it looks nice - and is very safe.  I keep trying to convince my friends to get this gate so I will have no troubles when I visit them - those other gates confuse me and are hard to use.  This is truly the only you will need.,5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is a nice gate for a door opening, probably not the best choice for a stairway. We found it easy to install and is well made.  I don't know how some people found this to be junky.  The wood looks nice, too. Gates are a barrier not a babysitter, so for the price we found this to be good for door openings to our hallway.",4,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Very pleased with these gates.  I have 2 of them in my house and my mother has another.  They all work good and greatly help keep the kiddo where he should be.  They could be a lit more rugged and the latch could be a little more user friendly, but neither of those things are that big of a deal.",4,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We use this gate for a 36"" opening at the top of our stairs.  The gate is sturdy, and opens easily with one hand.Installing this gate alone seemed like it could get a bit tricky, especially if you want everything 90 degrees to the floor and level across the top.  Fortunately my father-in-law helped me out.We ended up mounting a 1""T x 4""W x 30""L piece of wood to both sides of the wall (these were mounted into studs) to guarantee that the mounting hardware would be screwed into wood (in case the mounting hardware screws missed the stud due to the 1-2"" offset between the swinging and latching sides of the gate).If installing this on a wall with molding, keep in mind that the bottom screw hole of the latch side hardware is the lowest screw mounting point . . . otherwise you will end up installing this screw through the molding like we had to.  FYI, our molding is 2"" high and we installed the gate 2"" off the ground.  If we had installed the gate 3"" off the ground (maximum height recommended by the manufacturer) we probably would not have run into this problem.For the price, I don't think there is a better permanent mount gate out there.",5,1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,I think this is a great gate for the price.  The instructions are no help though so you are on your own to figure out how to set it up.  The natural wood makes it inconspicuous and I really like the simple design.,4,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,This product seemed a bit high priced but the dino's are well made and will last forever.  My grandsons use floor puzzles as a background rather than the flimsy plastic that comes with this but it has lots of pieces and will do for several children to play with at a time.  I paper with names of different dinos would have been nice also.  Overall good purchase.,4,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This was a last minute Christmas purchase for my 5 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs.  She has a few plastic ones that she plays with from time to time, so I really wasn't thinking about getting any more... Then I saw this item and thought she'd have some fun with it.  To my surprise, this has become her favorite thing to play with; even beyond other items, including a karaoke machine and a kids tablet stocked with e-books and games.  It is so nice to watch her acting out various scenarios with her community of dinos.  I couldn't have imagined how much fun she'd have.  The dinosaurs are well made, nice coloring and features.  Good variety.  The mat, volcanoes, trees and rocks are a nice touch, sometimes she uses these, other times she just lines the dinos up by family on our living room coffee table and acts out various social situations between the dinos.  I love seeing her pretend play!  Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs has turned out to be a delightful surprise.",5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My 2-1/2 year old son got this playset for Christmas. He LOVES it. To challenge his mind, the name of each dinosaur is printed on the bottom. I can see that we are going to get hours of endless play with this set! Great job Animal Planet! We have two birthdays in January for friends turning 3...they will both be getting this set.",5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,The dinosaurs are great.  The concept is good.  One of the trees was broken as they are a bit flimsy but that didn't really affect it overall.  I also wish the mat wasn't so thin.  My kids like playing with it.,4,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,this is a cute little set and makes a great gift! Everything comes in a tub so you get storage. I picked a coupld of these up for my kids as well as an extra for a neighbor's son. Both boys and girls will love this set if they love playing with dinosaurs!,5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"Gift for grandchild heard it is really nice, good quality.  A good buy for the money.  My grandson loves it!!!",5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,I bought these for my grandson who loved dinosaurs at the time.  He has outgrown them but still has them.  It was a great gift and well worth the money.,5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"got this for my daughters 4th bday. shes developed a love for dinosaurs, which I love because I loved them growing up too! they come in a nice big tote she can carry around and makes for easy clean up. the dinosaurs come in all sizes and seem very durable. the mat was kinda flimsy and not really what I was expecting but for the price and as many pieces you get, I cant knock any stars off. the dinosaurs will probably spend more time in the bath tub and around the house rather then on the mat anyways.",5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"The dinosaurs are very good quality.  Only complaint (very minor) about them is that the names of the dinosaurs are VERY hard to read...but this was fixed by my husband smudging some pernament marker on them and then whiping it off lightly with acetone to create some contrast with the letters.The volcanos, trees, and rocks are great too.  Love the storage bin.  The mat that comes with, however, leave MUCH to be desired...I'd almost rather it not have come with it.  The mat is super cheap looking and not durable at all.Overall, however, this is a great product that my 4 year old son is enjoying greatly!",4,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My son had a great time with this set. The only thing I didnt' like about it was the play mat. I thought it was way larger it is pretty tiny. My son still likes it so I guess that is all that matters.,4,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"MI HIJO AMA LOS DINOSAURIOS ASI QUE DECIDI COMPRARLE ESTE SET, LO MALO ESQUE EN  LA FOTO SE MIRAN MAS GRANDES CUANDO EN REALIDAD NO LO ES. :( SON MAS PEQUENOS QUE LO QUE SE MIRA EN LA FOTO ES UNA DECILUCION PARA MI PORQUE EL QUERIA UNOS MAS GRANDES.",5,1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"Bought this toy (or rather the version they had then) for my daughter when she was 2. She played with it for years and is now playing with her 2-year old brother. They managed to rip the plastic scenery (arguing on who got to play with it) and tear apart some of the palm trees, he also cracked one of the volcanoes by jumping off the bed and straight on it, but the dinosaurs have survived all sorts of mishandling and rough play. The bucket is miraculously whole considering that it has also been used as step-stool, seat and pretend bath for dolls.The fact that the dinosaurs have their names printed on the belly (not easy to read) gives me the opportunity to tell them their real names, and learn for myself too!All in all, the most used toy in our home. I dare say one of them has played with the dinosaurs almost every day since we purchased them three years ago. They are the first toy out and the last back in.I would buy this again and look forward to giving it as a gift too.",5,1
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2","I am mother of 4, grandmother of 3... Best pacifier around! Size 2 is good for the most months, latex is most easily accepted by newborns and breast fed babies, and Nuk is most natural shape. I wish these were more available, but worth the search!",5,1
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2",No complaints. Nuk is a good product. My baby takes every pacy. Easy to clean or just throw them in the bottle sanitizer.,4,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Don't get me wrong, I do like this walker.  We bought it for my 7 month old, whenever he would get in it he loved it.  Except that the legs(the part that makes it taller) wouldn't stay in the groves, and kept falling to the floor.  So he wasn't able to walk in it.  He is in the 95% in height, but only 60 in weight.  There was no reason for this to happen.But like I said I do like the Walker...Just not very sturdy..expecially for bigger babies.",4,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We received this walker as a shower gift.  After hearing mixed reviews about the safety of walkers I was hesitant to let my son use it.  When he was about 4 1/2 months old we put him in it for the first time, and he loved it! The activity tray has a great variety of toys.  We also really like the fact that the tray comes off and he can put other toys or Cheerios on it. This walker is very stable and well made. At 10 months my son cruises around the house a record speeds and is just about ready to walk on his own.  This toy has really let him explore the house safely.  We all love it.",5,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy, but gets frustrated that she is ""trapped"" and can't roll easily on carpet.",4,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,My twins love it.  Larger wheels allow it to roll over the groves/mortar between stones of kitchen floor better than older walker we have.,5,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Having three children I decided to go with the walker. We never used one before because it was never recommend by Dr's. This center is the best. It has stoppers so don't fear your little one can't move. Pull them out and you can push them from room to room with you with the handy holder in the back. The baby loves it and I think it's great. Also, Mom's who have taller babies this one lasts longer than the average bouncer;seems it adjusts higher than the others.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Great size, easy to assemble.  Would recommend this to playard to anything that asks.",4,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I loved this play pen, it is square and nice and roomy for my son to play in, he moves around easily and has great color schemes that are so eye catching. My son also likes to take his naps in this playpen, he is very comfortable in it and can stand easily. the extra toys built into the sides amuse him all the time and it is very easy to fold and un-fold for very easy transportation when we go on vacation and to take inside and outside. Love this playpen and my mother-in-law liked it so much she bought one for her home as well.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I love the graco pack n' play playard colors.  I got it for my 5 months old son a month ago.  There are four different activities for him to play with and it is big enough for him to crawl around.  You do need to put a blanket at the bottom for him to lie down in the winter.  It is light enough to travel.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I love this pack n play because its SOOOOOOOOOOO spacious.  My son loves the little bugs and can lay in it for a while (4 months old).  I think as he gets older he'll enjoy playing in it and I'll feel good because I know its a safe place for him to be.  Would recommend.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I searched and searched for a square playpen from the olden days.  Well this fit that criteria perfectly!  I hated to keep her confined to the new smaller pack-n-plays to play in.  To nap is one thing, but to use as a play yard at home is completely different.  She is currently 6 1/2 months old and will play for about 20-30 minutes on her own before her attention span is gone.  This allows me to prepare dinner, clean up a little, or even just sit on the couch and RELAX.  She may still be young, but she's on the move already.  This keeps her in one place, where I left her.It does slope to the middle, but she doesn't have a problem with that, even if I sit her down around the outside of the mat.  She only plays with the crinkly butterfly and hasn't taken the time to discover the other sides to play with.I would recommend this to anyone with a baby girl or boy!!!I (a woman) opened this up and set it up on my own the very first time within a few minutes. We have not taken it down or moved it since I set it up in the living room.  I specifically bought it as a playpen and not a travel pen.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and have bragged to other friends, that have babies similar age, that I have an Old School Style BIG playpen.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","My friend had bought this pack and play and when my son and I went to visit for a play date I was amazed at how content he was playing in the playpen. I quickly went online to buy one for my home and he is in there now as I am online. I have more free time to do dishes and sweep and do laundry, all while I watch him of course. It has the mirror which he loves to look at and giggle, the butterfly wings he likes to teethe on, simply put money well spent! I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would tell every mom to invest in one!!!!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is for our baby girl. She isn't using it yet but I have set it up.  It's so much more compact then the one I had as a baby.  Easy to fold like a regular port-a-crib but larger. I bought some fleec to make a fitted sheet for the bottom. That is the only draw back. There is no fitted sheet that matches to order. It is wipeable though. I know this will come in handy until she learns to scale the sides and escape.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is not a portable product in the way you think of portable.  It is sturdy and the bonus is it packs into a carry bag.  Folds up or out in seconds and is as sturdy as a non-portable.  very large compared to what they sell in the stores about twice the size but not too big to be a hazard.  What would I change about this product? NOTHING  It even has toys on each of the sides for children.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This play yard is extremely easy to set up quickly. Compared to another I've tried to set up, this one beats it by at least 10 minutes, plus it doesn't exhaust me doing so. Each side snaps up and there is a mechanism to push when releasing. The mechanism on this play yard is easier on my ""older"" fingers and I can do it easily.Taking this on a trip would be great because the whole thing wraps up so compactly and fits into a zipper bag. Taking this outside during the summer months will be a breeze!My 6 month old grandson loves scooting around in this and the colorful images attract him from side to side.Overall a well thought-out item. I've been pleased with everything about this play yard.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This was the frst time our son had been in a playpen. With in minutes he was playing with the """"attached"""" toys. In short he loves it. It's perfect to keep him entertained while cooking dinner or taking a shower. It assembles quickly and stores neatly and easily in the included storage bag. We are considering buying another to keep at his grandparents. We would highly recommend the Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Wallyworld had this at the same price, but they were out of stock. The shipping was free, but I still didn't have to wait very long for it to arrive. This one is probably the biggest ""playpen"" any one can find. My son loves it! It's big enough for him to roll around in.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it.",4,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","the pen is perfect and bigger than the pack n plays with the bassinets.  i wanted something to keep my baby safe in while i was busy cooking or doing dishes.  he can safely play in this and the toys stitched onto the side mesh keep him occupied even if his toys dont.  the only downside is its hard to find playsheets locally.  you have to source them on amazon.  other than that, its a great playpen!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Bought this for grandchildren's visits seven years ago.  Now being used by our church nursery.  My daughter liked it so much we recently bought another one for her home.  Good quality and construction.  I like the full size space that allows a toddler to play safely while a parent has to direct their attention elsewhere.,5,1

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We ordered this play yard for our daughter's 4 month-birthday.The order came in with Standard Free Super-Saver Shipping within one week.The play yard is very easy to assemble,attractive colors,great quality,comprehensive instructions,WONDERFUL designs on all four walls (including an unbreakable mirror),steady colorful and easy-to clean floor mat.What else could one dream of?We are 100% satisfied with this purcahse.Highly recommend!!!!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","After shopping around for a play yard, my husband and I found that this is by far the largest one we've come across. Also, the bright colors and little built-in mirror, squeeky, crinkle and rattle toys are great. It provides a good place for baby to both play and sleep! I would definitely recommend it.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is absolutely a great product. It is big compare to other pack and play and the reason being why we purchased it. We did put two cushions for a softer flat form. You will need two person to open this so the lever will adjust at the same time.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This play pen is the most used baby item we own. My two kids have used this over the past 3.5 years and it is in excellent condition.

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","As a grandmother I was looking for a safe space for my 7 month old grandson to play in.  The large size is great, it is simple to set-up and fold-up.  It is very sturdy and off the floor and the sides are entertaining as each has an activity (squeak, crinkle, mirror and rattle) and the bright colors are very appealing.  I was able to put a mobile on this Pack N Play at the corner.  We just love it and will be able to use it both in the house and in the yard.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I like it for the size and all the colors. Bugs on the sides are somewhat entertaining with rattles and squeaks.,5,1

Portable Crib Mattress,"This portable mattress fits perfectly in my Eddie Bauer Manchester Print travel yard(dimensions are 24x38 on both) and is slightly thicker(1/2 inch more) than the other portable crib mattresses that I've seen.Also, this one is waterproof and lightweight. It can be used in both the bassinet and crib portion of the aforementioned travel yard.MUCH better than using just the hard pad that comes with the travel yard.I should add that this also fits graco's pack and play portable crib sheets... which are the sheets I use in my Eddie Bauer travel yard.Seems to be fairly hardy in construction. Should last at least a year or two of regular use. If not.. well, buy another one. They're only $20.00! Regular moms(don't know about day cares) wouldn't need this any longer than that year or so anyway.",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I registered for this pump for #1: the price  #2: I had only planned on breastfeeding during my six week maternity leave so didn't see need for an electric.Well, I ended up continuing to breastfeed, and this pump has sustained my supply and kept my baby EXCLUSIVELY on breast milk. I work full time and am able to pump 3 four oz bottles while at work. Each takes 3-5 min, so bathroom trips are quick and pumping sessions discreet. No one ever realizes I am pumping in there.My daughter is 5 1/2 mo now and still exclusively on breast milk and I plan on continuing to nurse for many months to come. Pumping is not a big production with Isis. It's convenient and simple to clean- no hoses etc. It is as little of a hassle as I can imagine and that is so important to me as a working mom of a breastfed baby.",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Nice pump, will recommend to all moms. However it makes a funny sound when I pump and it is loud - I wish it was more quiet.",4,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My baby was in the NICU right after birth for 5 days and I needed to pump exclusively to get my milk established.  They provided me with a deluxe electric double pump which worked well.  I was told my supply couldn't be established/maintained with my manual pump at home, so I went home with a hospital rental while my baby stayed in the hospital.  When it was time for him to come home, I contemplated whether or not to keep renting the electric pump; I had received this ISIS pump as a shower gift and I thought I'd try it before deciding what to do.  Well, I was shocked how well this pump worked.  It is so comfortable to use and doesn't tire your hand pumping.  In the same time it took me to double pump (15 minutes) I got the same amount of milk using the manual one breast at a time!  I ended up returning the electric pump and didn't at all feel uneasy about maintaining milk supply.  This pump works as well, if not better than the electric pump and costs so much less!!  This is my 4th child, I've tried other manual pumps as well as battery operated ones in the past, but none compare to this pump.  My only qualm about this system is that the nipple rings and nipples for feeding are substantially bigger than the standard nipples/size for bottles, so you are committed to using only their brand with their bottles (the bottles are nicely shaped and easy to hold).  My baby had a hard time breast feeding, so we had to bottle feed for a while and he couldn't get the hang of their bottle nipple so I had to pour off my milk into another type of bottle system to feed him.",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Before I bought this pump, I read lots of reviews about manual, battery, and electric, single and double pumps. Since I only plan on having one child, I did not want to invest in a[n expensive] pump to use for a few months.When I returned to work my son was 3 1/2 months old, and I only planned on breastfeeding until 6 months. I used this pump in the morning (while he nursed on one side), once during the day at work, and during his night feeding. I was able to keep up with his daily regimen with ease.I was a little scared to try it for the first time since a lot of reviews said pumps in general were painful. This did mimic my sons sucking action, and was not bad. If you can get through the first week of breastfeeding (a different kind of feeling that no one can prepare you for), you can pump on a regular basis without problems.I like the how easy this pumps is to take with you. The carrying case is attractive, and looks like a regular lunch bag.",4,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My sister-in-law bought me this pump for Christmas. It's been great. It's never hurt to use it, I get a lot of milk fairly quick, and when you get the sterilizer too, its easy to keep clean and ready to use. Nothing is better than having a good pump on hand when you are engorged and baby is sleeping. :)))",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought the Avent on the go pump, after having difficulty with the electric pump(not a hospital grade pump)that I already had, because I am having surgery in May and I need to pump for while I am in the hospital. I found the Avent to be MUCH more comfortable than the electric one.  It is also very easy to express milk.  I did find that it works better for me without the massage petal attachment. (I get 4-6 ounces at a time.) I didn't get enough suction with the petal attachment on.  I am a stay at home mom so I only pump once a day.  I am not sure how it would be for a working mom but, it works great for what I need.  If you only need to pump once in a while or even once a day to get a stock up in the freezer I recommend this pump.",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Since I was going back to work when my daughter was only 6 weeks, I bought a Medela electric pump because I thought it would pump more milk in a shorter amount of time.  When I got it home, it was so loud that I didn't want to take it to work.  So I bought this pump specifically for work and now I don't ever use my electric one!  This one pumps a lot of milk out and it takes about the same time (for me) as the electric one.  And I use it almost every day with no problem.  Also it comes with everything you need to store the milk including the bottles (which are the only ones my newborn will take!).  And you can take it with you everywhere easily.  I recommend this pump to everyone I know whether you will be pumping occasionally or every day.  Best pump on the market!",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"As a first time mom, I was nervous about the whole pumping idea.  I read the reviews on this pump and decided to purchase it before the birth of my son, which was a good thing because I got the last one!  The first time I tried to pump I was scared it would hurt (after all the horror stories people were telling me)to my surprise it did not hurt at all, I was amazed at how quickly I was done and the ease of clean up.  My son quickly adjusted to the avent nipple/bottles and loves eating with his daddy. He is thriving on both the breast and bottle with no nipple confusion.(we started at 5 weeks)I love this pump. It is discreet and easy to use on the go, I highly recommend this pump. Thank you!",5,1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I was given a Medela Pump N Style when I was pregnant and spent a month trying to use it before getting frustrated and investigating other options.  I purchased the Avent Isis On the Go after much research, and it has worked wonders.  Not only was the electric pump loud and inconvenient to use, it was also an extremely slow process.  With the Isis, I can pump the same amount of milk in less than half the time.  I work full time, and the Isis is much easier to transport, put together, and use.  If you want to speed up even more, buy two pumps and pump both breasts at once.  You will still save 60%+ over the cost of a Medela.  Hands down the best pump on the market!",5,1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,This product I used with my first child 12 years ago and bought it as a gift for my sister recently. I have tried many brands and this one is great quality and great price. You will not be disappointed.,5,1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I tried a hospital pump & a highly advertised manual pump before this one and it was a nightmare. When I tried this pump I couldn't believe how comfortable it was, and how much milk I pumped so effortlessly in such a short amount of time. My baby is 11 days old, and last night I pumped 3 1/2 ounces in 5-10 minutes. It is louder than my manual (obviously), but not nearly as loud as the hospital pump I used while my baby was in the NICU.I think many mothers are trying to pump before their milk supply is established & that is why it hurts & why they aren't getting any milk. That is what happened to me in the hospital...even with the hospital grade pump you won't get anything if your milk isn't ready to be pumped!",5,1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"When I first brought my daughter home I used a manual pump but that took too long to get just a few ounces.  I bought this pump and could pump up to 6 oz. on one breast at a time.  I used my pump to build up my stored breastmilk for when my daughter began eating solids.  I pumped each morning and sometimes 1-2 times during the night for her first year of life.  Once she started weening herself, then my milk supply naturally started to become less and less.  However I used this pump each day and was able to have breastmilk stored for my daughter until she was 16 months old.  I recommend this pump because of the small, portable size, price, and convenience of using it.  Each pumping session took about total of 10 minutes (5 on each breast).  Each time I used my pump I only used the plug.  I never used the batteries and my motor did not start to go out until the time I stopped pumping.  I attribute that to having used it daily for over a year.",5,1
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"We loved the size, look and sturdiness of this portable crib.  Our 4 month old is quickly getting too large for her bassinet and this seemed like the perfect step up.Even with a portable bumper pad, my baby keeps kicking her leg through the rail while laying down.  I have to keep a sharp eye on her as I'm afraid that she will break her leg.  I first noticed this problem a few days ago as she was crying and when I turned around, her leg was sticking out.I pretty much only put her in it when she's super drousy but I'm going to take it back and get a play yard as I don't want to take any chances.  I already have a play yard at her daycare center and didn't want to get another one, but it will be so worth the peace of mind.This crib would be great for babies that don't like to kick as mine does.  She's a little wiggle worm!",4,1
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"We purchased this as the primary crib for our second child to save on space and knowing at times we would need to move the crib between rooms.  I absolutely love it!  It is very sturdy, looks great and best of all rolls through doorways!!!.  I assumed I would be able to use the crib for only several months when I puchased it, but as our little guy is approaching 12 months I have no intention of pulling the full size crib out of storage anytime soon.  He has plenty of room to move around, in fact, far more than I have in my bed. By far the best piece of furniture/gear I have purchased between 2 children.....",5,1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I received this bottle warmer as a gift!  I love it!  It sure has made a difference - it heats the bottle faster than a pot of water can boil!  I recommend this!  My daughter loves the warm the bottles!,5,1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"works in seconds, and the light on the button makes nights very easy for breastmilk and formula. I love it",5,1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"We purchased this to use in our bedroom while our daughter is still in her bassinet.  It is wonderful for those middle of the night feedings.  We did not find it hard to use at all, and the bottles are pretty much always the same temeprature, and have never really been too hot or too cold.  We use the Avent bottles (which are great, by the way) and they fit in there fine.  She now (at 2 weeks) often sleeps through the night, so we don't need it quite so much anymore for nightime feedings, but we still use it during the day to warm her bottles.  It takes a few minutes to warm up the bottle, but I change her diaper while it is warming, and it seems to work out well.  And at least it shuts off by itself after the warming cycle is over . . . many other units do not.  The cooler is a wonderful feature as well . . . saves us from going to the kitchen in the middle of the night!!",5,1
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I had read about the Isis while I was pregnant and hoped it would work so well.  My husband was skeptical that a manual pump would work that well.  So, I got the pump with the disposable system so I could freeze the milk.  I started pumping at about 1 month and got 2 oz the first try.  Soon I was getting 4 oz in less than 10 min and still nursing regularly.  So, I had a stash in the freezer when I went back at 10 weeks - in addition to the milk we used trying to get my little girl to take the bottle.  She is taking it very well now - at 12 weeks she is using the #2 nipples and the 9 oz. bottles (she doesn't like the disposable bottles, so they just pour the milk into the bottle from the bag).  Now, I can pump about 4 oz. in the morning then nurse her and at work I take two breaks where I get at least 7 ozs in less than 10 min.  So, I am pumping what she eats each day (or more).  I try to push it a little to keep ahead.  The pump is so small, I just put it in a little tote bag and carry an insulated bottle bag for the milk (got that 'free' at the hospital).  I am so happy that she is still just getting breastmilk and we're still a few days ahead.  Its also wonderful that the system is interchangeable.  In the morning I pump into a regular bottle so her first bottle can be fresh.  That also works on the weekend.  I like to use the lids with the sealing disks to carry milk around in, the nipple lids leak sometimes.  I am interested in trying the soft sippy nipples with the bottle when she gets older.  Its just all working so well - Avent has really developed a great system.",5,1
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"MY NIPPLES CRACKED SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET MY CHILD TO LATCH ON THE RIGHT WAY. BUT I STIKK WANTED TO BERASRTFEED AS LONG AS I COULD. SO I WENT TO THE STORE AND PURCHASED THIS PUMP. IT WAS THE CHEAPEST AND IT WORKED GREAT. ON THE FIRST TRY, I WAS ABLE TO COLLECT 10 OUNCES IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.I ALSO LOVE THE CARRYING CASE THAT IT COMES WITH, VERY DESCREET.",5,1
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I have gotten breast pumps in the past, and did not like them becasue they hurt and did not work at all.  I have recently bought this aven isis pump, and let me tell you this is a goddes when it comes to pumping! it works awesome, and it does not hurt! i would reccomend this pump to other moms who are planning on puchashing one.just one more thing the nipples are really good to my baby would not take any nipples untill this one i tried the playtex ones he refused, this one is really good.",5,1
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I think this is a gret product for a good price.  It was easy to put together.  I didn't even use the directions, just looked at the box.  I love the storage underneath, it helps to keep everything organized.  Very sturdy.  The only bad thing i can say is that the baby will get his hands and feet in between the rungs so be careful when you go to pick them up.  Other than that, I would highly reccomend this product",5,1
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,I love it.  It is very soft.  It fits snug on the mattress and won't slip off.  A nurse in my hospital said mattress pads are safe as long as they stay on.  I have no complaints.,5,1
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"This is the best mattress pad I've seen yet!  It is thick, soft, washes beautifully but best of all it fits the crib mattress perfectly without having to pull and tug on it trying to get it to fit only to have one of the corners pop off anyway.  I highly recommend this. I wish I'd had this from the start.",5,1
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I purchased this pad with the BRU Sealy UltraSoft Mattress ($59.99 avail. online)and I couldn't be happier.  I was nervous about the whole crib and bedding purchase b/c of so many different reviews, but I have to say I'm happy I got it right the first time.  The softness of the pad evens out the firmness of the mattress and it's a comfortable bed that I would love to sleep on.  The mattress fits perfectly without the pad and even better with the pad (for overprotective moms who want no finger room between the crib and mattress).  The sheets for her room theme also fit like a glove.  My 9 month old daughter is transitioning out of her bassinet and I have to sneak her in the crib b/c she's not yet used to the extra space, but the first time she slept until 8am and her normal arise time is 6:30-7am.  I am a happier mom with this purchase.",5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I breastfeed my son and recently started supplementing with bottles.  My mother highly recommended the Playtex Nursers (that's all she ever used) and bought me this set after I had terrible luck with some other bottles.  My breastfed baby readily took this bottle with virtually no fussing (and less burping, gas and spitting up).  After experimenting with the other nipple shapes I found that my son prefers the regular shaped nipple, but I liked that I could try them all out with one purchase.  I've recently bought some extra Older Baby nipples, and of course, liners, but other than that, this set has provided me with more than enough ""equipment"" and I'm sure it's the only set of bottles I'll need.",5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I put this set in my registry because these particular bottles have a good reputation.And, believe me, my son loves it!It especially came in handy when I discovered that when my son came out of the hospital, he started to choke on regular nipples.These don't go down his throat as much, so I can definately avoid choking.You can also take the air out of the bags, so it takes away most of the gas.",4,1
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"While I was pregnant I had heard about these bottles and that they were essentials for breastfeeding moms. I, thinking they weren't ""as pretty"" as other bottles decided to get something else. I tried everything and my baby girl was just not having. I was nearly in tears thinking about going back to work and that my baby would not be able to eat. I spent hours a day trying to get her to eat with other bottles and was so frustrated, worn out, and emotional.I finally got these, and honestly, I couldn't wait to get home to wash them and try them out. I held my breath and gave it a go..I couldn't believe my eyes, not only was she not screaming bloody murder, she loved them. She ate four ounces right then.My advice to all pregnant and nursing moms is GET THIS. Don't delay. Try to introduce a bottle early on (around 4 weeks) and get these because they work. My baby girl loves the latex nipple because it is soft like the breast.If you google coupons for Playtex you can find them all over. I used a $2 off coupon I got from ""liking"" Playtex Drop Ins on facebook and then waited for a sale at Babies R Us (30% off)  and ended up getting this set for about $11, but honestly, I probably would have paid over $100 for them that's how amazing they are!!",5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I bought this gate after reading all of the positive reviews. I have to agree, I really like it! It was easy to put together (despite not having instructions) and it feels very stable. Also, measure your space very carefully. I measured wrong and had to order an extra extension. In total, I have the main gate plus three 24"" extensions.",5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,I have an area that is unusually hard to fit for a baby gate. This is the only gate that would work for me! You really can bend each little 2 foot section any which way to fit your needs. The gate part is easy enough for my older kids but also difficult enough for the little ones to stay put. I would've been lost without this gate!,5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.The elongate was to cover an area of 84"""".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.I highly recommend this gate.",5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,This is the first gate the actually accomodates our irregular stairway.  It is adjustable and so versatile.  It is sturdy enough that I haven't even mounted it to the walls.  I absolutely recommend this gate.  I wish I had known about it with my oldest daughter.,5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"you get what you pay for in price and lemme tell you it's amazing!!! BUY IT! you wont regret it...need a simple gate for stairs, or one for a fireplace, large opening, work out area like a treadmill or entertaiment center this thing works for anything!",5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I love this gate!  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this gate is, and it's worth every penny!  We had purchased the Safe and Secure gate, because it fit our opening and was $80 cheaper than the Configure Gate, it was such junk that we ended up returning it and spending the extra $$ for the configure gate.  It is easy to install, and easy to open and close.  This is the best gate out there!",5,1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We have weird staircases in our house with stairway walls that don't line up and banisters that make standard gates impossible.  This is the only gate that would work in sealing off our 2nd floor main living space from the stairs that lead to the foyer/finished basement below.  (See my pic above)  The joints allow you to customize the angle at which the gate extends from the walls.  If you need to remove it completely (say, if you are having furniture delivered), you can do so by pressing on the tabs at the top of each wall mount.  It's a handful, but one person can do it.We actually have two of these gates, since the stairway up to the bedroom level has similar issues that make most hardware mounted gates impossible.  In that case, we have the gate configured in a 90 degree angle, and it works equally well.As for operation, it is easily opened with one hand (while carrying your little one) and yet secure enough that our 13-month-old has yet to figure out how to do so himself.  When open, the doors stay open without swinging shut automatically, good for people who have pets and want them to be able to roam freely when the baby isn't home or is asleep in his crib.  (We have two cats, one of whom can easily jump the gates, one of whom cannot.)Of course, it's one of the most expensive hardware mounted gates sold, but well worth it in terms of flexibility and ease of use.",5,1

Our baby is 4 1/2 months, and we've had to go into her room several times/night to replace her pacifier for 4 months(didn't have the heart to let her cry it out). The lullaby player has helped us in teaching her to go to sleep on her own. She no longer has a pacifier in her crib. I wanted to use the rainfall or ocean sounds for white noise, but it turned out our baby liked the lullaby setting better.The voice activiation is why I bought it and why it works so well. We rarely go into her room at night now, because as soon as she cries, the player turns on.The only bad thing is a really bad thing. It just inhales the batteries. I assume it uses them so quick because it has to be on all night so the voice activation can be ready. But, we have to replace batteries AT LEAST one a week. This product would be perfect if it could be plugged in.",4,1
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,i bought this to help my 10 week old baby sleep better.  and ever since i have started using this she sleeps better and longer.  the lullaby mode sounds a little wierd but i use it for the heartbeat and waves!,5,1
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"Our son had problems falling asleep and staying asleep for the first 3 or 4 months.Luckily, we bought this product and have been using it every night since.My son is now 13 months old and turns this on himself when he goes to bed or wakes up in the middle of the night.  This seems to be his favorite crib toy.And it still works wonders on getting him to sleep when he is not feeling good, extremely tired or fussy.The voice activation feature is a great idea!  It's the only way to go.The night light is also an awesome feature.  It's not too bright and not too dark.  The button to turn it on is easy to find in the dark.  It's great to use to check on the baby, change the baby's diaper, etc.  (It's not too bright to turn on and wake your spouse if your baby is sleeping in your room)This product is just such a good buy.It clips onto the crib, bassinet or play yard.  We have used it on all three.This was definitely a life saver for my husband and I, especially the first 4 months.It's also very durable.  We have never had a problem with this and it still looks as good as it did when we first bought it.This is a wonderful gift to give to new mothers or mothers-to-be.  They will probably get quite a bit of use out of it.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After reading the reviews of these bottles leaking, I personally found a way to keep from it.  When heating in the express bottle heater (after being in the fridge), I loosen the top of the bottle to let the pressure out.  After its ready, I then take the whole top off, wipe off the condensation on the rim (inside and out), then screw on snug, but not real tight.  It solves the leaking problem.  Another review I read said that screwing on too tight also causes leakage.  Ive not had a leaking problem since I started doing this.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had been afraid that my breastfed baby would prefer the bottle once I started pumping. Instead, we found that he did not like the bottle at all. We had received a free sample of the Avent bottle, and discovered that he liked the nipple much more than the ones on the Medela nursing set that goes with my breast pump. He still would much rather get the real thing, but daddy finds it much easier to feed him with the Avent bottle. My one concern is that the plastic is much more rigid than that of the Medela set...am afraid of dropping over hard surface.",4,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Avent bottles are the closest to mother's breast as far as the nipples and the shape and quanity it holds is great. It is very easy to pump breast milk into. I have tried other bottles but i keep coming back to Avent they are the best. All Avent products are superior to all others.Mom of 2 children and one on the wayI will only use Avent for my kids.ThanksAna Soto, New York",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I love these bottles! I haven't had any problems with leakage as I did with other brands, and I just love how Avent makes other products too. I have the bottles, sterilizer and the breast pump and I love them all!",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles for my first child 2 years ago and loved them then.  Now with my newborn, they are still like new, and I still love them.  I breastfeed her, but she takes one bottle a day without a problem.  Yes, if the white rim is screwed on too tightly, they will leak.  Simply check before feeding.  I've really enjoyed using there entire feeding system from bottles to sippy cups to sterilizer.  Very well made products.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Since I knew I wouldn't be breastfeeding after returning to work, I began researching bottles before my daughter was born.  Avent bottles received great reviews and now I know why.  The transition from nursing to bottles was a breeze thanks to the patented design of the Avent nipples.  My daughter never developed nipple confusion and never once rejected feeding from the bottle.  The Avent bottles with the wider neck are easier to clean and the Avent sterilizing system makes them even easier to sterilize.  I recommend this product to any mother who wants whats next to best when it comes to feeding their newborn.  Of course, nursing is the number one method.  The only reason why I didn't rate this product a 5 star product is because the bottles are unusually wide.",4,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"OK first they are easy to clean.  Second the nipples DO NOT collapse. Third, they cut down on bubbles.  Sometimes they leak, but thats easy to cure...DONT SCREW EM ON SOOOO TIGHT!  LOL....buy em, you wont go wrong!",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!! We tried the Playtex Brand. We tried the Johnson's Brand.  He still got gas after feeding.  I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work. He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!! Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas.  Thanks Avent!  To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum. It's the bum on the bottle. You're feeding him wrong. To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say:  Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out?  Nipples do get clogged you know.  It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean.  Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple.  You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I switched to these bottles when DD was approx. 5 months old.  I *love* these bottles.  They have been wonderful for her spit up issues and they are easy for both her and I to hold.  Let me start by saying I was very hesistant about buying this bottle due to the bad reviews about it leaking.  I have not had this problem.  I have found (another user posted this and it works) that you should always assemble the nipple and the ring whilst wet and when you are screwing the ring on to the bottle, give it a counter clockwise turn until you hear it ""click"" into place and then proceed to turn it clockwise until closed.  Also, do not tighten it down like Heman would.  You just need it to be closed and sealed.  Another thing that made my purchase worry free was the fact that I bought them from Babies R Us and told them of my concerns and they told me if the bottles leaked, I could bring them back with my receipt.  All in all, these bottles are great and we have not had one problem.  I will use these with any subsequent babies as well.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I loved the Avent bottles.  I am breastfeeding my son and needed a bottle that would be like my breasts.  At first i used the Playtex Vent-Air, but when i would breast feed him he would be confused, but none of this happened with Avent!",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used these bottles with my little sister 6 years ago, & I started my son on them (with breastmilk) from birth.  It's very easy for them to go from breast to bottle, I loved the pop-in cap for storage, and ALL Avent pieces are interchangeable!! I had to switch to Dr. Brown's recently because my baby has severe gas problems, but I would have stayed with Avent except for that. They're so easy to clean because of the wideness.P.S. As for everyone complaining they leak, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I read a recent review saying she didn't know why they left room between the threads that screw on the cap & nipple, the bottle info explicitly says this is to let air vent out, that is why they leak when you screw the cap on too tight. It just takes a light twist & it's on. If you've got a really gassy baby, go with Dr. Brown, otherwise, these are awesome for the breastfed baby!",4,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles, and they are great!! I was also suprised to see amazon shipped them in bubble wrap to prevent breaks and the package was completly sealed in sterile plastic!!",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really like the Avent bottles better than others.  My baby had difficulty with breastfeeding and had to use a breast shield, so he was used to the plastic.  When we decided to try a bottle for wee hour feedings, we tried Playtex, but he didn't like the flat nipples, and I don't think he liked the latex taste very much.  My lactation consultant suggested Avent because of the silicone newborn nipples.  We used this, and once he got used to having a bottle at night, he took right off.  The nipples still require the baby to suck pretty hard without just pouring out, so I didn't have as hard a time with him going back to breast during the rest of the day as I did with other brands.  Also, we enjoy the Avent Bottle/Baby Food Warmer.  All in all, I think these are superior to the others on the market.",4,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I love these bottles. I really like them because it is smooth feeding for the baby.  When the baby is sucking it does not sound like the baby can not keep up with the flow of the formula.,4,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Intially I bought both the Playtex (with the bent top) and the Avent. My daughter didn't show a preference at first but after 1 week of being both bottle fed and nursing would only take the Avent. She is more comfortable with the nipple that fits her mouth more like a breast. I have had no problems with leaks or getting the lid/rings on &amp;quot;just right&amp;quot;. Now I am having to buy more Avent bottles and left wondering what to do with the other Playtex bottles.....,5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We switched to these bottles around our son's 4th month - prior to that we were using the Playtex Vent Aire bottles.  Compared to the Playtex, the Avent bottles are MUCH better.  The Playtex bottles have FIVE pieces (nipple, nipple ring, bottle shaft, air filter and screw-on bottom).  Too often, when one of us would shake the Playtex bottle with formula, it leaked and we would have to take the entire bottle apart again to find the leak.  Meanwhile ""The Baby""(tm) cries like he hasn't been fed in four days.The Avent bottles leak every once in awhile when shaken, but I have found the fault is my own - I just don't have the nipple ring tightened completely.  Fortunately its a quick fix and the little nipper is satisfied much faster.  There are only three parts - bottle, nipple and nipple ring (four if you count the bottle cover) - so clean up is SO much easier.  These bottles can be washed in in a jiffy.  Plus, the size is nice - up to 9 oz., depending on what your kid needs/wants.  The size is also nice for holding the bottle - I find they fit nicely in my meaty paws.  Our son likes them too - he can easily hold an Avent with both hands now.  Overall they are nice bottles.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had asked for these bottles when I was pregnant with my son. I ended up breast feeding exclusivly and never ended up using them. I found out that you could buy a """"sippy cup"""" spout to use with them. My now 2 year old uses them daily. They ended up not being a waste of money because you could use them for more than just a bottle. The quality is really good and clean up is easy.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used this system for my son.  He easily switched back and forth between breast and bottle, even at an early age, and never had problems.  The wide mouth is great for mixing forumla.  It will leak if you don't screw it on just right, but that's the parent's fault, not the bottle's! He never had a problem with gas or spit up, and transitioned into the sippy cup easily with the Magic Cups and the bottles being interchangeable. I am pregnant again and would never consider using anything else!  I am looking forward to the new disposable cups.",5,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,My baby loves these AVENT bottles. I haven't had any leaks in 3 1/2 months but maybe I'm just lucky. The bottles are very easy to put formula into and my baby loves to grasp onto the wide bottle.,4,1
3 - in - 1 Feeding Organizer,"I'm currently breastfeeding and I use bottles whenever I need to leave.This organizer was the best out there.I love the fact that the two baskets could be used for the dishwasher since there is a lid stored underneath.The down side is that you could only fit a total of 7 bottles.Avent 9 ounce bottles are not one of them(don't know about the small Avent),but I still put my Avent bottles in it,just won't fit on the bottle holders.Like most parents,I have more than 7 bottles,I store the rest of my bottles somewhere else.",4,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,My wiggly giggly girl sits in this booster.  For us it has worked much better than the hard plastic that is available in most stores.  My only frustration is that the travel bag was not shipped with the item and it was really impossible to figure out how to get one sent to me that I gave up trying to get it.,4,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"My 26-month-old daughter would only stay in her high chair for about 10 minutes then would beg to be taken down.  Our regular table chairs are too low and she wouldn't stay in them very long either.  The first time we tried this booster, she had a smile on her face from ear to ear. The table was at the proper height for comfortable eating and she sat through her whole meal! She has never done that! The booster is made of a special non-slip material and it really works. My daughter got spaghetti sauce on it and it wiped right off.  When I bought it I thought that the price was a little steep for a foam booster, but it is totally worth it! I highly recommend it!",5,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,I love this seat!  My four year old son uses it at the kitchen table and moves it to the den to boost himself up to use the computer.  It is so comfortable and portable.  It is extreamly easy to clean and the best part is it doesnt have space under it for food to fall.,5,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,Soft and comfy. Easy to clean. If it gets a nick in it or if your toddler is a biter it is easy to pick at and pull apart.,4,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"This is an excellent booster seat!  My cousin bought one for her daughter, so I decided to try it for mine.  Nice and comfy foam material that wipes clean very easily and is lightweight to travel with.  My 2 year old loves sitting at the table like a big girl now.  It brings her to a perfect level to eat at the table.  I have fabric padded kitchen chairs, so I keep a towel under the booster to keep food from ruining the chair fabric.  Highly recommended!!!",5,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"At first I thought $29.99 was a little pricey for a foam/rubber booster chair, but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  We had a rambunctious almost two year old that was a squirmer in his highchair.  After it arrived he was so proud to be able to sit at the table in a ""big boy"" chair and eat with us, it immediately changed the way we ate as a family (in a good way). Within a week or so the highchair was rounded up and sent off to another family that needed one - and we never looked back.That was almost two years ago and he still uses his booster every day.  He can sit in the chair without one, but he is so much more comfortable with his booster.  It also allows him to sit much higher in the chair which is great.  It's also very easy to throw in the trunk for quick trips to grandma's.In the end this was one of those ""successful"" purchases (vs. the purchases where you buy those miracle devices that end up in the closet).If you are looking for a booster seat - consider your search over.",5,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,Got this thinking we would use it primarily at friend's houses but its turned out to be really useful in our dining room too where it is now semi-permanently installed.

Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"We have a 20 month old boy who was getting too big for his infant seat but too small for a chair.  When I saw this booster online I thought it would be perfect, and it is.  It portable enough to take anywhere and he just loves it.",4,1
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,"This thing is pretty good for a bottle drying rack, comes with a little shelf for drying nipples, Sturdy, drains well, allows you to make different configurations in consideration of your bottle sizes. I like the size because it isn't huge butcan dry several bottles. COmes with a kinda flimsy bottle brush, will be a back up. Good product.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"When I was 2 years old, I tripped and busted my head (and needed a few stitches) on our living room coffee table. So now that my little boy is old enough to surf around the furniture, I was worried he would do the same.These foam corners are exactly what I was looking for. They're not overly bulky, but do provide enough cushion that he won't get hurt if/when he stumbles into a sharp corner. Before I bought this, we were given some plastic corner guards as a baby shower gift, but they were just a hard as the wooden table. Junk! I also like that the brown color of these thing somewhat resemble the color of the wood so that it isn't an eye sore.For the cheap price, and free Amazon shipping, this was a great deal. I'd recommend it!",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I purchased this table guard about a month ago. I feel that the padding itself is pretty cushiony (especially if compared to the expandable table guards) and I feel it would prevent a child from seriously hurting themselves if they should run into the table. However, I also felt there were a few problems.  You have to apply the four pre-cut foam corners to the table (easy), then you have to measure the rest of the foam, which is one long piece, to fit your table--and you have to be EXACT so USE A TAPE MEASURER (easy). However, cutting the foam was NOT that easy. The directions suggest you use a serrated bread knife - we opted to use a razor knife - but still ended up with some gaps. This certainly does NOT look good and cannot be fixed! The tape they give you to apply to the table is NOT very durable and I don't see it lasting. I don't know how easy the tape itself comes off the table, but I do know that the foam is constantly coming off of the tape. Plus small children, like mine, are forever pulling the foam off of the table - which IS very easy for them to do. My children are always playing near the table now since they enjoy pulling the foam off so much! Another dissapointment is that the foam only protects the top and sides of the corners - whereas I would have prefered it covered the ENTIRE corner (top and bottom) in case a child is reaching under the table and hits his/her head while standing up. Also, if anything gets spilled onto the table - which DOES happen with kids - it will lessen the durability of the tape. And you WILL get crumbs in between the table and the foam - which IS very hard to clean. Overall, the product is good and does serve its purpose.  I will definately keep the foam on my table since I feel it will help to prevent any serious injuries, but I am going to also be ordering one of the ""expandable"" bumbers to cover it.  This will cover the ugly gaps, prevent my kids from pulling it off and hopefully, my friends won't notice the collection of crumbs I have acquired since I have put the guard on the table!",4,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We purchased this NOT for a child but for my wife's father. As he has gotten older he getsvdizzy spells and has stumbled against his dresser on several occasions injuring his arm. This went on the edge easily and looks nice. Great product for a good price.,5,1

"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","it worked fine.  but cutting it to the right size wasn't the easiest and i was off a couple times.  it seems to be sticking, but my toddler hasn't tried ripping it off yet.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem.

A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","The table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a 1"""" space in the center of each length works great.

BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"When my daughter first showed an interest in using the toilet, I bought one of those cheap toppers from Walmart. After a couple months I realized that it was starting to fall apart. The handles started to come off and then the seat started to tear exposing the foam on the seat. It was really gross...Then I realized that I should of invested some money for the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer I originally wanted.My daughter was so excited to use her new toilet trainer when it came in the mail!She ripped the box open and ran to the bathroom to try it out. She loved it so much she would not get off the toilet.I really love the quality of this product.There is no tearing foam or handles that will eventually fall off, cleaning is a breeze, and it adjusts to different toilets. So it's great to take on vacations! Oh most importantly since I just had another child she can also use it in the future without it falling apart! Definitely a good investment!",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I saw some other reviews saying that they had issues with some other slow closing seats.  Our son hasn't used this yet, but I wanted to say that this fits our toilet seat PERFECTLY - it's VERY stable!!!  Our seat and toilet have an elongated shape - not round.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We're struggling with potty training our 3yo boy and these potty seats have been great! They are all one piece so there aren't any cracks and crevices that you have to clean, and they are contoured perfect for his little bottom.  There is a handle on the back so it's very easy for adults and kids to lift it off of the toilet, and then you just drop it back into place when your little one needs to go potty.  My sister recommended them to me (she's already trained two kiddos) and we've been truly impressed - as impressed as one can be with a potty trainint seat that is! (wink)",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers.  He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Love this seat.  With the cheaper seats w/ Disney designs, etc, the pee was always getting everywhere but the potty.  This is perfect for my son.  The bump between the thighs keeps his legs apart so pee gets IN the potty instead of on it and it is deep enough so that even if the pee does not go straight down and still gets in the potty and does not leak under the seat.  Fits well on our toilet seat.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had a cheapo toilet-top seat before this -- it was messy, pee shield too low, had a rough edge which hurt my son. This cost two-three times as much, but MAN is it better! It's awesome -- easy to clean, pee shield tall but safe, comfy for him to sit on... and we're finally making potty training progress! I HIGHLY recommend this seat.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I initially bought this potty seat based on reviews that said it was good for a boy.  It seemed a bit pricey, but was cheaper at amazon.com than anywhere else.  My main objective with this was for my son to poop on the toilet.  He has constipation issues, so I thought a potty would be easier for him than trying to poop in his diaper.  He does what we call a ""poop dance"" so we always know when he has to go.  His little bottom fits well on this seat, and he uses it with ease.  The shield in front is sufficient.  We have not had any accidents yet.  Common sense says to keep his boy parts pointed down, though.  My son is on the small side, but I think this potty seat will carry him through his training.  I like that it is adjustable to fit on all toilets.  We are currently using it on an elongated seat.  As we are not seriously training yet, he does not get on and off the toilet himself.  He does try to put the potty seat on the toilet himself, though.  All in all, I highly recommend this product.  It is easy to clean and sleek/contemporary looking.  A lot more expensive than the $8 potty rings, but worth it for the comfort of the kid and the fit on the toilet.  I have just ordered a second one, and will most likely be taking it on vacation with us.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I think you have to like this toilet trainer.  It's comfortable, reliable and easy to clean.  This is a better model than many alternatives.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is all around great!

BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,And it's so easy!  It stores under the cabinet and my son pulls it out and uses the bjorn step stool to climb on the potty.  He has no problem placing this on the toilet.  It cleans super easily too.  Just wipes down.  HIGHLY recommended!,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Early on this is probably the harder way to train (compared to a separate potty) and when little boys pee sitting down you do get a little ring of pee on the toilet seat.  However now that we are potty trained (at 2 years and 3 months) it is perfect. We don't have to teach about going on a different seat or anything. And it stays on the seat easily with little adjustment and pull right off without any trouble if someone else needs to use the potty. I will be using this for my second child as well.,4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I have yet to try a Baby Bjorn product that I don't love.  They consistently produce smart products for kids that are made at top quality.  I read most of the reviews on this seat before buying it, and here are the things that stand out to me after using it for a couple of months:1.  It looks great.  The white is clean-looking and fits in in any bathroom without looking gawdy.  In addition, it's not ""dated"" with any particular character--I'll be able to use this same seat for subsequent children (boy or girl) without any problem.2.  It FITS!  Granted, I've only tried it on the toilets in my house (elongated seats), but the adjustable wheel on the back of the seat means that it will fit snugly and not slip around if a wiggly, squirmy child is on top of it.3.  It's so easy to clean.  I don't care how hard you try, or how well designed you think a potty seat is designed, it WILL get pee on it.  Fact of life.  The question is, does it wipe clean easily are you left in the bathroom scrubbing with an old toothbrush trying to get into all the cracks, nooks, and crannies?  The Baby Bjorn seat, with its simple, all-in-one design is easy to keep clean by wiping with a little toilet paper, and then disinfecting as often as you like with a disinfectant wipe.  On a side note, sometimes we wind up with pee on the regular toilet seat (from splashing underneath the Baby Bjorn seat) and sometimes we don't.  I'm not sure there's ANY potty seat out there that will guarantee you never ever have to wipe up pee.  We're talking about toddlers/preschoolers here...there will be some pee to wipe up from time to time.  Again, I don't see it as a flaw with this seat, because I've yet to find any other seat that does any better.4.  It's a great design for kids.  My son sits comfortably now, and has room to grow (we started potty training around 20 months).  No, he can't get up and down by himself, but neither would I want him to at this age.  As he gets older and better able to use the potty by himself, he'll also be getting bigger and better able to get up and down by himself.  I don't see the problem with this (even though others have complained).",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Loved it, fit the oblong seat, carry it with us to daycare every morning so he's more comfortable to use the toilet there, has a great little 'bump' in the front that acts as a liquid shield, great product!",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect fit, easy to use, my 3 yr old can place the seat on the toilet himself and can sit on it with the help of a small step stool.  We rinse it off and hang it on the back of his bathroom doorknob.  The seat doesn't wiggle at all, which I could see being a huge issue with some of the other over the toilet seats.  Worth the extra money.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I was so happy to find a toilet trainer that fit my elongated toilet seat.  My son is comfortable on it.  The open space is large enough for a male child to do number 1 and 2 simultaneously w/out having to adjust his position to ensure pee lands in toilet!,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"The Baby Bjorn potty seat is super easy to use - just stick it right on the seat and turn the dial to tighten or loosen.  It works perfectly with our elongated toilet.  Our 2-year old son uses it with ease and is perfectly content to sit there for a long time - sometimes longer than I want him to - he's happy just hanging out on there reading his books.  That said, I do notice that his bum is red when he gets off, which makes me wish the seat were cushy.  However, he does not seem uncomfortable sitting on the seat at all and will sit there for 20 minutes sometimes.  So, I guess he is comfortable and whatever is causing the redness doesn't bother him.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,All the other toilet seat covers we tried didn't fit. This one fits securely and is easy to clean. Great,4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My daughter really likes her pink potty seat. It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her.,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My son first used this in Sweden and I had to purchase it since he was very comfortable using it.  Easy to use and easy to clean.,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This was easy enough for my toddler to put on the toilet. It's simple to clean and fits well. We very much preferred this over the potty seat that doesn't sit on the toilet - my son wanted the &#34;real thing&#34;. We really love this toilet trainer.,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son has been using a trainer potty, but if I never have to wipe one of those out again it will be too soon.  Borrowed another type of toilet-mount seat, but it slipped around and pinched his legs.  Then I came across this one, and it is THE BEST!!  I never knew I could get excited about a toilet seat, but this has really made my life easier.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"It's amazing how when you have a quality tool, it makes the job easier.  This is the case of the BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer.  It's the best fit and works great for our three year old.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect, easy to use. I like the tightening turn under so it fits any potty in the house. I've tried other seats. This one is the best for us.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Great product, I've purchased 2, one for the baby's home and one for our (grandparents) home. We recommend it highly.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son it doing well with this seat, no little potty, staight to this seat.  The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over.  Fits on the toliet really snug",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I bought this product for my son.  It is a great product and my son seems to be comfortable while sitting.  I have two of them and I think their great.,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This has made potty training for kiddos.  It's a great fit and helps significantly with training.  Need to get the step to help up and down.,5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Easy to install, comfortable for my son to sit on and has a very useful splash guard. The seat blends in very well with the bathroom and can be easily hung when not in use. Of all the seats out there, this one seems to be one if the most well made and most functional. Would highly recommend.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the best potty seat that you can buy.  It's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard.  Also, I love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had 2 other seat covers, but they would slide on the toilet seat and the guards weren't large. This seat is like the BMW of toilet seat covers. It seems very comfortable (not that I've sat on it myself, but my son can sit for a very long time on it), it fits most toilets (has a little wheel you turn to make the inside part get larger or smaller depending on the size of your toilet, which makes it not move around much), and it has a large pee guard. We've since thrown away the other seat covers and bought a few of these for our house.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Best potty seat we've used! At first my daughter wanted her own potty chair, but now that she is a little older (2 and 1/2) she is willing to sit on the big potty with this seat. It makes it so much easier to just flush the toilet when finished. We put one of those command hooks on the back of the bathroom door so we can hang it there when not in use and we hung it low enough so she can get it and put it on the toilet herself. She does however need a stool to get up on it or we have to lift her.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We have a rather elongated seat on our commode that most kids seats will not fit. This adjusted to our very well.,4,1
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"I actually bought this to keep my dogs in our kitchen when needed and so far it's great. I have a narrow hallway and right at the entrance to the kitchen is a cabinet and the fridge, the gate opens up enough to slide between the fridge alcove and the cabinet which keeps it very secure. It's easy to slide back and forth and opens up large enough to fit just about any size doorway. It's strong enough that my dogs can't bend it out of shape, tall enough they can't jump over it (not too tall for the cats though) and the top railing keeps hands and paws from getting pinched.The only reason I couldn't give the gate 5 stars is because over the 3 years we've had this, the railing has started to crack a bit so it doesn't line up properly which is a pain since the gate sticks and sometimes comes off the track competely which is hard to realign (though not impossible). This however is just my experience with it since our gate is battered by our Husky (she bangs against it to get our attention) and the way it is positioned between the fridge and the cabinet it's slightly bent so I knew it wouldn't last forever.I would recommend this gate to anyone without small children if you don't afix it to the wall. It colapses like an accordian and little fingers could easily get badly hurt (possibly broken) if the child figures the gate out. We had puppies who liked to stick their heads through the openings when the gate was fully extended, it nearly killed one of them when they couldn't get their head out and went into full fledged panic mode. While I wouldn't say ""STAY AWAY if you have kids of puppies"", just be cautious they don't stick extremities through the diamond openings.I will be purchasing another of this gate, it does what I want it to and for the money, replacing it every few years isn't unreasonable to me.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"It was great item to use for D.C. in the Mall area. My 4 year old and 1 year old were happy to both be side by side during our visit to the museum and train ride. I saved plenty of money not purchasing a double stroller. The strollers are small and fit in any car trunk without taking much of any space. Anyhow, back to the adaptors they work and I didn't have an issue with turning with Cosco strollers using these adaptors. Hope this helps.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"We purchased two umbrella strollers for our twins as ""emergency stroller"", and we got those connectors as well, of course.I can only say that it has saved our lives many times. One time (3 years ago), our main stroller was broken, and we had to wait for the replacement. Since we did not want to spend a lot of money, this was the option we chose.The connectors are cheap, and still extremely good. We have used them for over 3 years now, and even when they fell apart once, they still got back together with no effort and it still works all in all. The middle wheels of the strollers get stuck sometime, since they are apparently too close together. But, I figured my way out and I am very happy with this.We traveled overseas with the twins when they were 3 1/2 years of age. I was so uncertain whether to take a stroller or not, that still fits into the car after arrival at the new place. I thought ""alright, let's take the buggies. if something breaks or falls apart, it won't hurt."" It turned out all well and fine, and the stroller extremely necessary for the unexpected things happening at airports. We had to walk long ways, incl move of Gate at the last minute to the other side of the airport.Although I write a lot not too important for the connectors, I still hope to give some advice, especially twin parents. Even if not used as emergency stroller, this option can be used on a daily basis for shorter slow strolls.Super invention, and I am glad that there is something out there that allows low-income families to ""survive"". Great invention of our times!",5,1
Graco Two Piece Harness Tie in Grey,"this is made of a harder kind of plastic than the one my seat came with, but it still works just the same.  i put this on my Radian since that chest clip is SO HARD to maneuver.  love this, well priced and Prime shipping :)",5,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Another great product by 'the first years' !!This handly little CD player is great ! If you use the timer which plays for 15 minutes, you don't waste your batteries at all, I've had mine last 3 months, using it atleast once if not twice a day, before having to change the batteries, even when the battery indicator flashes, you can get another week or two out of it.  The volume goes quite loud on mine, I keep it quite low infact. It plays Enya quite beautifully,  the sound quality is quite good considering it's such a small piece of equipment.A very good investment ! I certianly wasn't disappointed, nor was my daughter :)",5,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,I have bought this for several baby showers and it always seems to be a big hit.,5,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4,1
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"This is a well made cover and is very soft, which is great for a newborn.  I also bought this item in sage and I am very pleased.",5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"My son is 12 months, but he is pretty small for his age.  We got this particular potty because of all of the reviews by people with young children.  It is a great size for him--He is 29 inches and 20 pounds.  We are just sitting on it several times a day to get him used to it.  He sits on it comfortable and can get on/off easily by himself.  I love that there is no bowl attached for him to take on and off.  I had read reviews about the downside being that it is easy for a child to scoot around on it.  We just got a stick-on non-skid rubber furniture pad and put on the bottom.  It works great to keep him from sliding around on it.  The price is also wonderful.  If you are looking for a simple potty to start a young child on, this is the one.",5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I started potty training my daughter on this potty at about 6 months.  She really took to by 9 months -- able to crawl to it on her own -- and mastered it by 19 months.  I even used it at her bedside to night-potty-train her -- just picked her up, put her on the potty, and put her back to bed.  Easy Breezy.She's is 3 1/2 years old now and we still keep this potty in our car for road trips, in case of emergencies, or when there's not potty available at the local playground.This potty is so small, it fit perfectly under our stroller and in a little bag so we didn't need to rush around looking for a toilet when on walks -- we'd just pulled out her potty so she could go.I love it.  No nooks or crannies to clean. No need to pack and unpack it. No need for diapers to line it (but you can do that if you want to as well.)TIP - Keep a spray-bottle of vinegar handy to disinfect it on the spot. :)",5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We love it, baby loves it, washes easy, good price, free shipping when bought from Amazon! Great size for EC babies!",5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,I got this one to carry around since we have the bigger one at  home.It is nice and fit in luggage and easy to carry around to potty traingreat buy!!!,5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,I purchased this potty after reading Diaper Free Baby.  I use it with my 5 month old daughter.  The size works well - she is in the 50 percentile for a girl.,5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!",5,1
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"I thought this item was great!  Everyone told me to just remove my coffee table until my daughter got bigger.  I read a few of the reviews and decided to try it myself.  I ordered the small bumper which supposedly fit the dimensions of my table, but like someone else said..it stretched alot further when my little one tugged on it.  I just pulled it tight and marked it.  I then cut it and sewed it.  I had to fight to get it on the table, but it works beautifully now.  (I did break a couple needles sewing it!)I would definately recommend this to anyone, but get a smaller size than you think you need.",4,1
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"This pad can be used for anything! I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on, under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time, and as a take along for diaper changes...no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa! Go figure.Also, unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.",5,1
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I used this to protect the Pack N Play and crib mattresses, which proved very effective. However, as a regular changing pad, it spends more time in the bleach bucket than in the nursery!  Regular burp cloths are softer on Baby's face and less bulky.  The only reason I can think to use the quarter sized sheets is for the annual visit with Santa.  Santa might appreciate that!",4,1
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I have a 9 month old daughter and we still use these multi-use pads.  We have had to sleep on the couch a few times due to her having a bad cold and I put one of the pads on the couch under a sheet, to protect the couch from accidents in the night.  I also use one of the pads on our changing station.  Hope this helps :)",5,1
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.",5,1
Graco Splat Mat,"This mat was great when my baby was learning to turn over.Later it was great to keep mess where it belonged: off my floor.It's easy to clean.Little enough to store,and will still be a great use for all those little crayon errors when my child learns to color.",4,1
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"We really like this gate.  We have a very wide stair case and bought the extension to go with this gate. (make sure you get the right extension) IT IS AWESOME!  My husband is really good with projects so we kind of made it better by putting a different latch then the one that was sent.  We also put some longer screws so that it would w/o a doubt stay in the wall.  It has been able to withstand our daughter pushing on it, hitting it w/her walker, and our doberman trying to get down our stairs.  So, all in all, it is a wonderful gate for children & animals!",5,1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"OK, my son is probably like most kids, wanted to try everything we were eating.  These are great!  You can put pretty much anything in there and they can just gnaw away, it is so great for when they are teething, put frozen mango, banana, etc. inside.  And when you are first doing solids, if you don't want to buy yucky jarred food, fresh is best and way cheaper (and much better than starting with cereal).  Buy extra mesh bags, organic whole foods, and you are set.",5,1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I have loved this product! My baby is now 6 months old and doesn't always want veggies with cereal. However, with this product, I just make a whole bunch of ice cubes with whatever pureed veggies I want, plop the cube in the feeder and she gets the vitamins and relief from teething! I plan to freeze pureed soups with meat and veggies later in this fashion. My only concern--some of the edges are a little sharp.",4,1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"After reading the inventors story inside the package, I went out and bought one for grandma's house. She is always nervous about the baby choking on teething biscuits, so this gave her peace of mind. You do need to break most bisquits in thirds to get them in the net, but it is well worth it.As others have said, some fruits are a bit hard to clean out of it, but I found if I hand wash them &amp; get most of the gunk out, then throw them in the dishwasher they are great.",5,1
Medela Nursing Stool,"A must have.  You may be able to go without the ottoman if you are in a money crunch.  I fed my son with this exclusively in my rocker for at least the first 8 months.  The ottoman was too high for me and I am 5'6""""",5,1
Medela Nursing Stool,"I purchased this stool 6 weeks into breastfeeding my son. I was having all sorts of trouble feeding him and lots of back pain. I was on the verge of giving up! I went to see a lactation consultant, and she had this stool in her office. Sitting in front of her with my feet up on the stool, I was able to feed him without trouble (she hardly had to &quot;consult&quot;). Once I had this stool at home, things started falling in place.Additionally, this stool has proven useful just as a stool, so your investment will last far longer than during nursing. My mom likes to put her feet up on it when she's simply holding my son.I also want to remark that Medela stands by their product. We discovered that one of the legs on the stool cracked (we think when someone tripped on it during a late-night feeding). I called Medela, and they replaced it immediately.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Live the color options, the style and well thought out design of this potty. My son is 27 months and fits on the bjorn potty just fine.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My father had made my daughter a potty, but it had the pot that slid from behind under the seat.  So there were little spills from time to time.  I bought this potty and my daughter loves it!!  It's so easy for her to pick up and flush and there is never a mess.  Definitely worth every penny!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We initially bought a potty chair from a local store. Each and every time my son used it I had to take it apart and clean every crack and crevice. I read the reviews on this potty and am I glad!! We ordered it from Amazon and the day it arrived my husband called me to tell me it was the best purchase we had ever made!! It's simple two piece design make it a breeze to keep clean. With the first potty my son would end up going everywhere because the splashguard was not high enough. This potty chair is almost oblong in shape and it keeps everything where it should be. It it large enough for my avearage size 2 1/2 year old boy. This is worth every penny we spent on it.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We had to buy 3 potties before going for this one. We tried: Graco with soft seat, but its splashguard comed right off; the 1st years 3-in-1 potty had a hole that was located too close to the back thus making it very uncomfortable for a boy, because everything got mashed; and a musical potty by safety 1st, which leaked. This potty finally works! But I am so surprised to find that there is no perfect potty on the market! Looks like consumer reports haven't done much job; one way or the other, big brands have left out our little kid's bottoms with POOR CHOICES, of which the best(truly) here to present - baby bjorn potty chair...hope kids of my kids will do better.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I chose this chair based on its reviews, and I am glad that I did! I can't speak for how it works for a boy, but it seemed to be really comfortable for our daughter. It's easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom, instead of looking like just another piece of baby gear. I also like that there weren't any crazy sounds or anything like that since it made the chair seem like a more realistic potty.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I had another potty seat I was trying to use that my daughter potty trained on and it didn't work so well with my son (things shot out that shouldn't have shot out...). This has a high enough guard on it so we've had no problems with things not staying in the potty.  It seems comfortable and I like the back on it.  My other potty seat didn't have a back and I think it's safer for the smaller kids.  This potty is a little bigger than my other, but it's not too bad.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,It fits snug on the tile floor and keeps the pee where it needs to be. Easy to clean up. Our son is tall for his age (99%) and weighs 29 pounds. He sits on this with room to spare quite comfortably. Happy with my purchase.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We started &#34;potty practice&#34; at about 21 months for my daughter. She's small for her age but showing signs of readiness. We borrowed another seat to get started and quickly learned all the &#34;extras&#34; were a distraction -- the other chair had a removeable foam seat and a lid. Not anything fancy, but she was curious and explored the seat every time instead of doing her business. We've switched to this chair and does MUCH better. It's easier to clean and just the right size.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My son loves the color and seems very comfortable sitting on the potty. He can still play with his toys and be comfortable because there is a back a sides he can push up from.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My first three children were born in Sweden.  We have used this potty for ever!  My oldest is now 20 so we passed it along to friends some years back.I will definitly buy one for my grandchildren.  It is easy to keep clean and even easier to store!  No extra parts/nothing to break either!,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This design couldn't be any more simple!  Two pieces of plastic. An insert that removes easily to empty out! Must have been designed by Apple's JONATHON IVE!  Now, if I could only get my little boy to use it a bit more often!  Still working on that one!  Great chair.  Highly recommended!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I tried a over the toilette seat for my 2 year old but we have the chair height toilets in our house and I think being that far up off the floor scared him.  I purchases this potty seat to try and he likes to sit on it and has pooped in the potty several times.  The splash guard is built in so it is not uncomfortable as the splash guard on the over the toilette seat one I have.  We are still in the learning stages but so far I think I made the right decision after researching so many different potty chairs.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I've been deciding betwieen this one and the smaller version, and I'm so happy I went with the one that has taller back support. I started using it with my 5.5 month doughter and she loves it, she seems very comfortable on it. We've been using it every day, for over a month now. She goes between 5 to 11 times a day. I still get to change 2-3 wet diapers a day, but for the past 16 days she went #2 only in her potty and not even once in the diaper.It's very easy to clean. Perfect size. Love it.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog.  It's known as ""ribbit"".  Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it.  So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back.  I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge.  I am very pleased with the depth of this one.  It fits him really good now.  I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months.  I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom.  It also has a really good front potty blocker.  I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"That's not true for all potty seats (some seem better designed for girls than boys), but since we have B/G twins and ideally wanted matching seats, we researched exhaustively. The Baby Bjorn Potty Chair was an excellent purchase and made potty training relatively easy.It's also attractive, comfortable, and cleans easily. 5 stars.We had red and blue but there are more color choices now, and note also that certain colors go on sale from time to time.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Does the job, no fancy bells or whistles- it's just a potty chair!  Still working on getting my daughter to actually use it for its intended purpose but so far she does enjoy sitting on it to watch tv.  I do like that the chair is not overly lare so it is easy to find space for it in smaller bathrooms.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I purchase this BABYBJORN to replace another potty chair that I purchased first for my son.  This one has a great shape that accommodates little boys without having to worry about """"overshooting"""" or """"spills"""" as my son calls it.  He is very comfortable using this and I would purchase this product again in a heartbeat.  It is very easy to clean and doesn't have many nooks/crannies that would make cleaning difficult.  This potty chair has been a great training tool!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty training chair is the best one I have used for my 2 yr old son.  He can easily get on and off of it, which is a problem with other chairs.  The ONLY thing I wish it had was a hole on the back of the chair to put your hand in to lift and move it.  Just grabbing the top of it to move where the potty is located is cumbersome.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have actually purchased two of these potty chairs because we were so pleased with the product.  Our son seems to actually enjoy going to use the potty when we started training him.  Early on, it was very difficult and we tried using a step stool and one of the seats that fits on the toilet but that didn't work well.  After purchasing this, things started going much smoother.  Overall, a great product and I would highly recommend it to parents trying to potty train their kids.  And it is easy cleanup as well.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back, and the raised front is great for little boys. We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys. I also have the shorter backed version, and they are both good for different reasons. This one feels a little sturdier, and the bucket is easy to empty. The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this potty. . .I found one in a garage sale, and had to go out and buy two more for upstairs, and my parents house.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Our son loves this potty.  It was delivered quickly, it washes easily, and it is simply wonderful.  Only positive things to say about this potty.  Highly recommend.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this potty chair based on reviews I read here on Amazon, and I'm very pleased with it and agree with what others have said: a higher shield that is good for boys, only 2 pieces so it's easier to clean, comfortable for the child to sit on, great grippers on bottom so it stays in place even if the child bumps into it while trying to sit down. Now if only the potty training itself were as easy as choosing this chair!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have on chair on loan in our classroom and almost all of the children want to use it so we ordered a second one to support this desire and to support potty learning.  It is well made and the children use it regularly.  It was a useful purchase, and we really like to beautiful green color.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have just started potty training my 33-month old son and he likes this potty chair very much. He loves it because his favorite color is red (his favorite car character is red), the cute bear(that what he said when he saw the potty chair first time) and comfortable to sit on it. I love the Babybjorn products and I love this potty chair too. No leaking,an integrated splash guard is working well and easy to grip the armrest when he stand up from the chair. And also the inner potty is easy to grip to remove and easy to clean. I'm very satisfied with this product. I would definitely recommend it!!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very sturdy, easy for child to use and removable section makes it easy to clean. Plus I love the pink colour!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"and hopefully our last!  Son liked it from the beginning.  Although we haven't had success on it yet, it is comfortable enough and roomy enough that he can sit on it for a while to get used to it.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This potty chair is easy to clean and kids love to use it!  It is convenient and easy enough to take on the go.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought it for my 10-month old son who is extremely active. So when i got it, I was nit even sure I can seat him on the potty and keep him seated long enough. But the seat is so comfortable that he can sit in it and listen to a song for a minute or even two before he gets bored - that is usually enough to get him do his small business there. He even tries to play with it getting the white insert out and putting it back in like a puzzle though we try not to let him play with the potty much. Word of caution -  when I tried to seat him for the very first time, he tried to just walk out of it and went down head-first - he was not a strong walker back then but I was ready and caught him and put him right back so he did not get scared of the experience. We had to pick him up to standing until he was about 10.5 months old and became more confident standing and walking though. He can stand up carefully from it - no stumbles since then.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very good material, nice and sturdy.  Smooth and rounded at all edges.  The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use.  Definitely deserves an award for design!  This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor's brands but it works for us because it's exactly what we needed for our daughter!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Sadly, this product arrived warped and wouldn't sit stable on the floor. Had to box it back up (um, bulky) and send it back.Found it locally and purchased. Love the product itself now that it sits safely and securely. Easy clean up due to the lack of creased and only 2 smoothly molded parts. Would purchase again.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We got this for our 14 month old boy and he quickly got accustomed to using this. It is very easy to clean and is low enough to be very comfortable. He grew too tall for it within six months and we had to get him to the baby potty seat, which was another training curve. I liked the product.",4,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This Potty chair, is a bit different from others on the market. While priced on the high scale, it seems much more comfortable for the kids, having a higher back support.Cleaning is very easy, and my kid loves it ...",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Our little grandson uses this and it's the perfect size.  Love how it's designed so no potty gets on the floor.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this chair for my almost-14-month-old son to get him used to seeing it and sitting on it.  I usually put him on it with his clothes on and he thinks it's funny to stand up and sit down over and over again.  I've put him on it a couple times without his diaper and most times he actually uses it!  I think it's more likely due to lucky timing, but I'm still so proud!  I'm not pushing the potty-training idea yet since he's not quite 15 months yet, but so far he seems happy about the chair.  I am a little worried about him outgrowing it before he is fully potty trained, but I'll probably just get him the BabyBjorn attachment to a regular toilet if that happens.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Don't think or look any more, just buy this one.  So easy to use, my son took to it right way.  That's after he had a not so pleasant experience with 2 others we tried first. This potty is lightweight my son can carry it from one room to another; super easy to clean no crevices to trap urine; and nicely designed.  No need for all the bells and whistles, they were distracting to my son too. He's been using it for about 6 months, now I just have to figure out how to transition him to the big potty.  BABYBjorn also makes a potty for that, which I will be buying too. Perfect!",5,1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,My husband uses these as sweat rags and I use them as dust rags.  They last forever.  Aren't as big as the last ones I got but this size works fine for us.  Wash them with some fabric softener and they fluff up nicely.,4,1
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),So glad I can still find the old cups that don't leak (unlike the new ones!),5,1
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),I really like these cups. They clean well and they don't leak.  She like to walk with it sometimes but I don't have to worry about the mess.  She likes the design too.,5,1
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I couldn't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet. The spittle and drool just wipes off, right? Not as easily as you might hope, and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier. They fit perfectly, match fine, and keep muck off the mat. Way to go, Graco - you've done it again!",4,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"This tub is great. It fits nicely in our standard tub. We had another brand tub and it was too snug, but this one fits perfect. My son refuses to take a bath unless he's in this tub.",5,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"I bought this for my son when he was about six months old - too big for the baby tub in the sink, but not big enough to sit by himself in the full tub. I looked at several reviews for other inserts, but settled on this mainly because it didn't seem (according to reviews) to be as slick on the bottom as others. Though we've not tried other tubs, I do appreciate the ridges on the bottom that help keep a wiggly baby and curious toddler from slipping and possibly going under water. The ridges have allowed him to catch himself if he slips.This fits nicely into the tub - a tight squeeze in my tub, but that keeps it from moving around. The sides also create a bit of a bumper for baby to hold. My son is a tall almost 2 year old and still fits very easily with his legs stretched out. We did have one that sprung a leak and if I'd kept the repair kit that comes with the tub, we would have been fine (unfortunately, it was lost in the abyss). We did, however, like it enough to replace the first with exactly the same model. I'd recommend it!",5,1
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,I used to use the disposable bags to store breastmilk in the freezer even though we used regular Avent bottles. When I found out these could be used in the freezer I switched and I LOVE IT! They CAN be used with the MEDELA PUMPS. There is a converter cap you can buy seperately to pump DIRECTLY into these bottles from most pumps! I would highly recommend trying this product.,5,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,bought another one for our other car.  works great. easy to install and remove.  can't find in store so we bought online.,5,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I got this car seat tightener because my 2000 Explorer does not have tether attachments--ironically, my Jeep Wrangler (a not-so-family car) DOES have tether attachments!  It was very difficult to get my son's car seat in tight enough to keep it from really moving around in a crash.  I LOVE this product!! If you can get your car seat installed by a certified tech, that's great and it's the way to go.  BUT my son's car seat is quite often going back and forth between our car and Grandma's car for Grandma-Fun-Days.  Are we going to go to a tech every time we move the car seat back and forth?! Yeah, right.  The Mighty-Tite is the ONLY reason I feel that my son is safe in my mom's car.  I get it in there SO tight every time, and really quickly, too.  This product is on my list of must-haves before my daughter arrives in May.",5,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"As the father of two girls, ages 4 and 1, please allow me to tell you from experience what a terrific product this is.  My only regret is that I didn't get until until recently, because it would have saved me countless hours installing car seats.  I don't care if you have extra car seats, you will always moving them in and out, switching cars with family members, vacuuming the car, etc.,--you will use this product.  Imagine this scenario: Grandma is watching the kids for a rare night night at the movies.  Invariably you have grossly underestimated how long it would take to get the kids and yourselves ready, and showtime is rapidly approaching.  You're just about to walk out the door when in an instant of guilt and embarrassment you realize you better put the car seat in Grandma's car, in case of emergency.  Suffice it to say that this process will cause you to miss all of the trailers and the first ten minutes of the movie.  Anyone who has struggled to install a car seat to ensure baby's safety knows that this process takes time, good technique, strength, agility, sweat, and a fair amount of cussing.  In addition, if your car's seat belts need to retract fully before they will feed out again, there will also be trial and error.  One of the tricks is to ensure the lap part of the belt is cinched down tightly at the buckle, while you have applied enough pressure (body weight) into the seat to ensure the seat does not rock side-to-side.  Mighty Tite makes this process a breeze!  Just play the belt through the seat as normal, cinch the lap belt to the buckle to remove excessive play, and then crank up ol' Mighty Tite to torque down the seat.  I won't suggest what potentially bad situation could occur, but regardless, that seat is going to stay put... Thanks I hope this product makes you all rich.  You deserve it.",5,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,We use the Mighty Religously.And we were in a rear ending--unknown impact force as I was driving 45mph and was purposefully rear ended by a very agressive hit and run drive.  I had to replace the rear door on my mini-van. The dent was rather impressive seeing as I was driving 45mph at the time.Mighty Tight had no problems.We did replace them and the car seats s suggested.  We do relocate seats often enough that it hasn't allowed the opportunity for the belt to relax over time.It is a wonderful product.,5,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,This is a great product. I feel that my child is completely secure using this device on her carseat.,5,1
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","I loved this product for a while, but now my baby who's just over a year pulls them off any surface and I keep having to press them back down and try to distract him from pulling them.

"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","I finally found these items after searching at every baby retailer I could think of.  They are truly a necessity for every toddler which no Mom should go without!  These toppers are so handy that I never worry over my daughter getting &quot;cooties&quot; from eating out.  They also fold up very thin so you can just slip one in your bag to take with you.  Clean up is really easy, just pull them off &amp; toss.",5,1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different.",4,1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",GREAT would be the word for this purchase! Too bad I could only purchase online from overseas as it is very hard to find this item in where I reside.,5,1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.",5,1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",These are great for easy cleanup; especially when you don't have a dishwasher.  You just have to wash the nipple.,5,1
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I am exclusively breastfeeding my baby and am pumping extra so her dad can give her a bottle a day.  The bottle size is perfect for newborns and infants under 1 year who are eating primarily at the breast and are just being given a few ounces of supplement size breastmilk or formula.  My daughter prefers the breast, but she latched onto the Medela nipples without a problem, and did not experience any nipple confusion when going for her next feeding at the breast.  The Medela nipples are very closely shaped like the real thing.  Also, I love how the caps can be used for cup feedings, too.If you have a Pump In Style regular or advanced pump, you'll really like how you can pump directly into these bottles.  Plus, it's good to have a few extra bottles that come with this kit, so you don't have to constantly wash the few that came with the pump and always have clean ones on hand.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,The bottles are the perfect size for one feeding. My newborn loves the nipples on those bottles and he cries when I tried to give him a different bottle. Works great with the medela pumps and is perfect for storage. It is one of the few bottles out there that is BPA free.,5,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"This is the best 20.00 that I have ever spent.  I am 6 months pregnant and have had horrible lower back pains.  I was sleeping with a mountain of pillows and hot pads and I was having the most awful time sleeping.  I read the reviews for this product and it was so inexpensive, thought maybe it was too good to be true.  It does take a bit of getting used to at first.  But I have no back pain at all when I sleep.  I don't even need a heating pad.  You'll have to find the right place to sleep with it.  And I agree with the other reviews, it would be nice if it was wider.  Don't waste your money on the fancy pregnancy pillows, this is where it is at!",5,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I read all the bad reviews and bought it anyway. Why? I was looking for a nice compact wedge to put on my lap when I read heavy or oversized books in bed. This is perfect! Just the right size and slant, and just what I wanted! For those not happy with it for its intended purpose, there still is good use for it if you like to read in bed.",5,1

DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!",4,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I have to pipe in here with 5 stars!  I was a stomach sleeper before becoming prego and was having a horrible, miserable time trying to fall alseep besides getting comfortable enough to do so.  Then I would wake up becasue my back hurt or I was on my back!  My friend said that she had a ""wedgie"" pillow and she was going to loan it to me!  Thank goodness I took her up on it!  Do give it a few days to get use to it but I'll tell you- the moment I tucked that pillow between my belly and the bed- I was a HAPPY camper!  It is like you are sleeping on your tummy.  I then put a normal pillow between my legs and I'm off to dreamland.  The pressure is taken off of you back and stomach as you can 'lean' into the Wedge. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and have been using it for 3 weeks and couldn't be happier.  Treat yourself and get this pillow!  Wish I would have found it earlier!!!!",5,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I bought this pillow when I was about 4 months pregnant because my back was starting to hurt. This has been a life saver! We have a queen bed, and this doesn't get in the hubby's way at night. It is not very big, but I don't like the big pillows. This one is just right. I have been using it for almost 4 months now and wouldn't give it up for anything.",5,1

Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I bought this at a second hand store (...).  It looks just like the one in the picture and was built pretty sturdy.  I hadn't intended to use it;  just wanted to fill an empty space in the nursery with something common.  The minute I put it in the nursery I knew I had to test it out, and it was a good find!  I probably wouldn't have paid (...)for it simply b/c I didn't buy it to use it.  But, now, I intend on using it, and recommend it to others as a wonderful open style dressing table.  It's sturdy, pretty, comes with a pad, has a belt for baby attached, has a lot of baby room on the table, and has lot's of storage space underneath.  It also looks good with most cribs, if you're afraid of mismatching.",4,1
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I purchased this for an exposed power strip in my husbands office. Our daughter always heads straight under his desk to all the cords and outlet.

But before you buy it, please beware of the dimensions of the product (see in product descriptions). It fits all our single-row surge protectors, and even a double-row extention cord with timer. it fits most of our plugs with transformer, EXCEPT some of the bigger ones. Unfortunately, the transformers for our router and DSL modem are too big to fit in, so we still have to find another solution for those...",4,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"When I had my daughter I planned to boil everything and didn't even look into sterilizers. What a mistake! When you're pumping, using bottles, and have a baby who likes her binkies, you're in for a lot of washing and boiling. Not only is it time-consuming, but you can't just pop it in the microwave and walk away like with this sterilizer. You have to either set a time or stay close by...I've got the melted, burned up pacifiers to prove it! It was easy to say, ""Oh, this nipple's been through the dishwasher, it's sterile enough."" But soon my baby had thrush, and I had to either pump or use formula.I was boiling like a maniac trying to keep the thrush at bay. Finally I got this sterilizer, but that was long after I'd had to give up breastfeeding and we were close to using sippy cups. This sterilizer is so easy to use and gave me such peace of mind. I wish I had invested in it before I even had my baby...but I know that when I have another I'll be sterilizing everything! I'm looking forward to just moving everything straight from the dishwasher into the microwave and walking away. No more boiling water for us!",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This is such a great sterilizer. It's easy to use and fast. I do four bottles at a time plus you can throw in a few Avent pacifiers and thier caps. This is so worth the money.,5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I really like this sterilizer. I did have to learn the hard way to remember to add water to it, or it will melt your items. I put my breast pump accessories and burned them up. So I just make sure there is plenty of water in it. It is a little hard to get out of the microwave when it is hot, but I just wrap a dish towel around it.",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,I got this for my first child because like every new Mom I wanted things to be sterile. I loved the easyness of use. This way I also had the bottles and their nipples all in one spot rather than flying around in my dishwasher which also uses unneccesary water if used every day only because of the bottles. Overall I thought this sterilizer is very helpful and I will use it again for my next babies fist months.,4,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I would recommend this steamer for anyone who plans on using bottles, breast pump and or pacifiers.  Since I was nursing i didn't buy a lot of bottles and hated to run the dishwasher for 3 or 4 bottles.  But when you need them, you need them and this steamer was awesome.  Just load the bottles, etc and water and zap in the microwave and in a matter of 5 minutes or so they're ready to go.  I would list this as a must have and have recommended it to a couple of friends who have tried it and feel the same way!",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This sterilizer is VERY simple to use.  You just pour in the amount of water according to your microwave wattage for the amount of time.  Recommended over the more expensive, non-microwave models.",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is a great product, if you need it.  I have a now 3 year old and twin 4 month olds.  I have only used the sterilizer about 15 times.  I bought it when I bought the Avent Isis Pump when my first child was about 6 months.  I needed the manual pump to take on vacation with me (smaller, takes up less room in the suitcase).  I never took the sterlizer out of my home, it is portable, but it is bigger than ""travel sized"".  I only used it when I sterilized the pump and once to sterilize the old bottles for the new babies.  My dishwasher (which I use everyday) and a dishwasher basket ($2 or less) work better than a $30 sterilizer.  When my twins were born 6 weeks premature, I used the electric Avent sterlizer at the hospital for the pump pieces (they provided one while the babies were in NICU). Now I just throw everything in the dishwasher baskets and turn on the dishwasher.Overall I liked the product, but I really didn't need it.",4,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized ""compartments"" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone.",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"After figuring out that I was going to pump and bottle feed, my husband went out and found this. It has been great! We sterilize not only the bottles, but pacifiers and my pumping equipment. I think that we will probably use it for some plastic toys as well, when the time comes. Within minutes the bottles cool off, which is great if they are needed as soon as possible.This would make an awesome shower gift!",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This sterilizer is great...not too big but definitely not too small. It holds (4) 4 oz. bottles or (4) 9 oz. bottles. Not to mention there are great little grooves so that you know everything is in there the right way. It is also great for the Isis breast pump parts. I used it daily while my baby was nursing and even now that she is 7 months old. We had a pretty bad case of thrush which the Dr. said was most likely coming from the pumped bottles I was doing for her. The dishwasher was not cutting it obviously when it came to sterilizing for my baby. We bought this steam sterilizer and within a matter of 2-3 days the thrush was completely gone and never came back. I highly recommend it. Although I don't find it completely necessary for it to include the (2) 9 oz. bottles with it...seeing as if you are using this you most likely already have bottles. GREAT STERILIZER!!!!,5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,LOVE this sterilizer and use it all the time. A little tricky to get them to all fit but I've got it down to a science! Even fits the 9oz bottles if you place them strategically :),5,1
"Mam Mini Ulti Gem Size 1 Latex Value Pack, Multiple Colors","I love these orthodontic pacifiers - they're the best.  And for convenience, it was so nice to be able to purchase them online, as they're difficult to find in some of our frequently-shopped stores.  But the fact that you can't request a color is pretty stupid.  Our baby is a boy, and we really have no interest in getting red, yellow, pink or purple pacifiers, but requesting specific colors is not allowed.  (We were sent 2 yellow and red packs, by the way.) It would be a customer-friendly choice to allow shoppers some individual preferences with these.",5,1
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This sterilizer is so easy to use!  With our first child we boiled everything in a pan on the stove and often scorched something if we became distracted by a screaming baby.  But with this product, you just put in a little bit of water, load it with whatever you want to sterilize, push the button, and walk away.  More than just Avent products fit in this, including Medela breast pump parts.  So far we have not found anything that doesn't fit in this sterilizer.  We highly recommend this product - it is well worth the money!",5,1
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"Now that I am going back to work, and my baby has to use the bottle, this sterilizer is great! Not only did I use it to sterilize my baby's bottles, nipples, pacifiers...but I also use this to for sterilizing parts of my breast pump. This is definitely better than the microwave sterilizer. It automatically shuts off when it's done, no need to worry once you switch in on. It's like having a separte dishwasher for your baby.",5,1
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I'm not sure how I made it through having my first child without this.  It's so quick and convenient to use.  Works great for bottles, pacifiers, and breastpump attachments (even though I have an other than Avent brand breastpump).  With my first daughter I used the dishwasher to clean her bottles which was not always convenient.  When the dishwasher needed to be run and when I needed to wash bottles didn't always turn out to be the same times.  This is also great for travel.  I've had this sterilizer for 9 months and LOVE IT!",5,1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.",4,1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I have an Ikea changing station and this works great to help keep everything handy while changing the little guy.  It fits a Pampers wipe holder just fine.  There's not much more to say, if you're looking for something to organize the changing station and want a practical simple solution, this is a great product.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,Product was as described and works prefectly with my changing table.  This is a must have product.  Product shipped quickly,5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is a great item. Was perfect for storing diapers, wipes, brushes, balm, etc. right on the side of either a bassinet or pack-n-play. Keeps everything organized. Glad I found this!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it... They gave us the Diaper Depot as well. I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table. It has lasted two kids before the one it's on now, so a total of three babies. I guess like anything if it's taken care of properly it won't break.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I bought mine about 4 years ago and I do like it. It has held up well, even with constant use. It holds quite a few diapers and as long as you don't let it get down to only one left, they don't fall out.The place for wipes will hold any size container and does accomodate warmers.I have a standard changing table and it hangs nicely on the side, keeping my little guy from playing with it and keeping it out of the way.My only complaint about it is that the accessory compartments need to be bigger. They can hold the basics, but not much else. (I could only fit a sample size baby powder in it. The bigger size? Forget it.)Would I buy it again? Yes, I would, but it is so well made that I won't have to.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This thing is awesome.  We've used it since my son's first bath.  (He is now 3.5 months old.)  He loves bathtime, probably because this braces him securely and keeps him in the water so he doesn't get cold.  Don't bother with those too-complicated contraptions, this streamlined bathtub is the best out there.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub like 2 months ago when my daughter was 5 months old.  She was getting too big for her infant tub, but I didn't want to wash her in the regular bath tub.  She loves it!  The first time I put her in she was a bit scared, I guess because it was her first time being in the water with a lot of room to play, but after that first time she got used to it.  I never realized how much she loves the water until I got this tub!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","someone must have REALLY known babies and mothers while designing this tub. Its so safe and secure, my son loves it!Hes 12 weeks old (Very small though, around the 29th percentile) but he loves it! We do keep a little washcloth to keep him from slipping too much, but the infant side really holds him! I bathe him on our counter (with a towel folded underneath!) and its amazing. I always wash my son holding onto him and lifting him a bit, but its really easy to get to him in this tub. like the previous reviewer, our son LOVES bathtime so we give him a little while to splash around (all while we are watching!! I usually wipe up the counter area and dry off his soap bottle and stuff!) Hes so content in this tub and I know it will last forever! My 18 month old niece is in the 89th percentile for height and she LOVED the toddler side. She had never liked the big tub (was intimidated) so her mother really washed her in a very large plastic bin (infant tubs were too small!) but once she tried this she was amazed! It is shaped so baby can sit up and splash and have a grand old time, AND they have their back to the little edge for soaps! She was so happy and nice and comfy!As for the size, we dont mind it at all. We just dump it outside, or slowly dump it in the sink, than rinse it out a little bit, dry it and put it in our laundry room (adjacent from the kitchen) I still cant see how a small apartment couldnt find room for this, put it under the sink, in a pantry/closet, under a bed or the couch, but its really not as big as many baby items out there!Its never gonna break beacause its all durable plastic. I am shocked in the ingenious design of this tub and GRACIOUSLY thank the person/people who took into consideration all the toils of bathtime with a baby/toddler!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We received a sling-style bathtub for our baby shower and our 5 wk old daughter HATED it! Before her umbilical cord stump fell off, we had to have her in the sling. Even when you are pouring warm water over them, they can never stay warm enough. Once the stump fell and we had her in the tub, she was SO squirmy and I was afraid of her slipping as I tried to hold her with one hand and wash her with the other hand - she was uncomfortable and screamed at every bath.The EuroBath is COMPLETELY different! It holds her in there so nicely, she LOVES tubby time now! I had this since before she was born but was afraid of using it because it looked so big and she is so tiny. I wish I would have used from the beginning! Since it is plastic, I keep a small towel behind her back while she is still unable to hold her head up completely just to make sure she is comfortable. I can tell this will work wonderfully for many months to come.It is large, so I don't know how well it would work if you are tight on space. She has her own bathroom, so we just keep it in her bathtub for now. I will be purchasing this for any baby shower I attend from now on! It's amazing how much my baby girl is enjoying her baths now!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Just returned home from a 2 week holiday at my brother's home in Phoenix. They had this tub and my 3 1/2 month old loved it. She kicked and laughed and enjoyed it thoroughly. We knew we would probably purchase one when we got home even though she liked the tub we had for her already. And guess what happened - our first day back home, she fussed and protested for most of her bath today in her current tub, basically telling me it doesn't cut it anymore after ""tasting the good life"". So I'm off to buy the Primo, which by the way, is much more eye appealing in our master bathroom than the bright blue one we have now.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I brought the euro-tub for my son,I read the reviews and was impressed. I had it shipped all the way to Bermuda! My son has used it since day one he is now 5 months old and he enjoys splashing in the tub. I like the no fuss clean up, and no silly sponges to ring out! It is a big tub to store, but I stand it up in the main bath tub out of sight! This was a great investment!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","At first I was registered for one of the 4 in 1, transformer bathtubs until a friend pointed me to a few negative reviews I hadn't read. The one about the baby boy's private parts getting pinched and STUCK, requiring medical attention, scared me in to finding a bath that didn't have any seams or grooves or moving pinchable parts.This bath is large and doesn't fold at all, but I loved it nonetheless. I gave up the bottom portion of a hallway closet for storage, removing a shelf, and it was totally worth it. It's useful for infants who can't sit up unsupported if you use the reclining direction. Then when they're older, you put them in facing the other way and they can safely and comfortably sit up without slipping or tipping. I think its size contributes to its sturdiness and safety.Our first HATED baths of any kind for almost the first year, but even so, this bath kept her safe and supported so it made the not-so-fun task of giving a bath a little more tolerable.We loaned it out to a friend in between kids and now have it back only we're missing one of the tubes for the drain. I was going to just go to the hardware store and rig something up, but instead called the company today (PrimoBaby) and they're sending me one out, free of charge. Can you even believe it? Who (other than Medela) has customer service that good nowadays? I know it's a cheap part that probably costs them 5 cents, but it'll cost me more than that in gas for me to drive the 1/2 mile to the store to find something similar that may or may not work.In conclusion: Yes, it's large, but other than that, I have zero complaints which is more than I can say for just about any other product I currently own.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our 6 month old twin boys LOVE this tub!! Finally a bath tub that fits all size babies &amp; can grow with them (unlike other brands). This is a smart design. This tub is dynamic with it's soft contoured mold design that fits perfectly under babies arms &amp; legs. It supports baby in all the right places. It's easy to fill, we simply set it on our kitchen counter and extend the sprayer hose from the faucet to fill it up. There is plenty of room for babies toys and lots of room to splash..... which for the twins creates alot of smiles &amp; squeals of delight. In fact our babies splash so much that we have to put full size bath towels on the floor just to absorb the water!!!! I've read that other parent think this is too big...we also did at first until we used  &amp; realized that it really isn't all that bad &amp; it is definitely worth it.....STILL UNDECIDED?? Here's a helpful hint ....  The tub stores PERFECTLY on the bottom shelf of the changing table. Voila Storage problem solved:)",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","The ratings don't lie - this is without a doubt the BEST baby tub on the market!When our son was born, we were given the 4 in 1 tub as a gift.  Based on the poor ratings it got, I didn't even open the box.  We tried using a giant 'tub sponge' and then graduated to a mesh sling that the baby sits in in the tub.  I don't reccomend this type of product because my back was a mess, and when the baby learned to roll over, he nearly fell off into the bathwater!By then he was too big for any of the small infant tubs.  The Eurobath has been the best solution we could have imagined!  It is contoured so that my now unruly 6 month old cannot squirm his way out no matter how hard he plays during bathtime.  And it's deep enough that he's covered with water and doesn't freeze (a godsend in cold New England winters).The only design modification I'd make is a better drain.  The current drain takes way too long, and the baby is cold by the time the water level goes down enough so that I can rinse him off with clean water.  I usually end up bailing the tub out with a big cup.If you're worried about it's size or where you're going to store it, don't let that dissuade you.  I was concerned about the same thing, because we have a very small bathtub (circa 1972).  It's snug, but it fits!  As for storage, we just keep it in the big tub and remove it when we need the shower - it really isn't a problem at all.Other than the drain issue,  this tub has every feature a parent could  want!  Don't waste money or time trying anything else - this is exactly what you need to keep your baby safe and happy during bathtime!",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is an excellent tub for new parents. It can be used for infants and does not need to be discarded after a few months since it can hold children up to 24 months. Although it seemed large when it came in the box, it is perfect even for use in a small apartment - it is sturdy andcan be put on a counter as needed then hung on a door or in a closet forstorage.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I like this bathtub-size better for babies because there is more room for them to lounge in, get bathed in, and feel the warmth all around them.  I prefer this to the others i.e. one that is almost as large but has a smaller insert that can be used for the infant.  More work and more surface area to keep clean.  This is practical.  It's the cat's meow!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I wanted something comfortable, safe, and high quality for our 4 month old.  This is a great tub for her getting ready to sit up on her own.  It is big, and takes up almost the whole bathtub, but it beats the others since it creates her own bathtub.  There is plenty of space for her to kick and play. It drains easily and easy to clean.  For the price you will get your deal, especially the end result is a happy baby :)",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Great tub for a new baby. Super easy to clean baby and keeps them in place. I would recommend buying a big sponge for the to lay on because the tub is hard plastic. It just makes baby more comfortable,5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","What a great gift, the baby is finally big enough to fit in the tub. The best tub around we love it",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub based on all the reviews I read about it. I purchased it when my son was already a year old because he was getting to big for his smaller tub. My son loves to play in it and I feel that he is safe while bathing.  The only drawback to it is that it is enormous. It is hard to store away without taking up too much space. Otherwise, the bath tub does its job and it is easy to clean.",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My 18 month old daughter doesnt like being in the bathtub itself and she was growing out of her old tub so I bought this one and love it!! It is really big but she's a big girl. Very comfy and there a stopper that is between her legs that keeps her from slipping down. She loves it and I would recommend it most definitely. Easy to clean and durable plastic.,5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I wish I had had this bath tub for my first child 7 years ago, and my second 5 years ago!  This is a tub that, if you are planning to have more than one child, is especially good because it doesn't have any pad to get moldy or time-worn.  We got it for our third baby, who is now 2 months old, and even if we don't have more children it has been well worth the money and extra space it takes up.  It really isn't enormous, just larger than the other tubs, which frankly I was frustrated with until the babies were at least 4 months old, only to have them outgrow it 2 months later!.  This one works well from day one, even for ""sponge baths"" when they're newly hatched.  The contours are great no matter what Baby's size, the tub is very easy to use and clean, and no great bother to store.  I am looking forward to using this bath when she's able to sit up - I won't have to put her in the regular tub and break my back & neck trying to reach her, wash her, and keep her slippery self from sliding around, while hoping she's enjoying her bath time!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our son is now 15 months and he is not even close to outgrowing this tub.  The infant side of the tub is great and was always very secure for our son when he was younger.  Who cares about padding; at least your baby is actually in the water, securely without getting cold. It's much better to fill this tub up with water rather than wasting water filling an entire tub with only a few inches of water. We will be using this tub for several more months.  We love it!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have to say that this tub is great.  Before this tub, I purchased a few of those smaller infant tubs only to realize that they could not grow with my baby.  I love this tub because it is large enough for my 18 month old to splash around and be comfortable, and also because I don't have to bathe her in my big bathtub which has sliding glass doors.  It is so roomy that I even put my other daughter, who is 7 months, in the tub and bathe both of them at once.  The only drawback is storing the tub, b/c it is large.  Definitely worth the price for all the use you will get out of it.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Have enjoyed it for the last 9 and half months. Need to make sure not to fill it too much but there is a line to show you.,5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Once baby had outgrown the sink, we were stuck using the one I originally registered for - a ""space saving"" model. HATED that one. Too much work. Read reviews and bought this one - baby is now 15mos and we are still using it. LOVE it. One tip - for small infants, use one of those big sponge things to keep baby from sliding around, or put a wet handtowel behind them. Oh, and I use to store it on the back of a door. Used one of those stick-on-hooks to hold it up. Worked great, out of the way & able to dry out. Buying this for all of my girlfriends for their baby showers.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub!  My one month old loves it too.  I purchased this tub based on several reviews about babies loving it.  I think my baby loves his bath time because he is able to sit in a good portion of water, so he doesn't get cold.  The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no cushion/padding for him.  He's so small that he somewhat falls to the side, but I have been putting a towel down first for him to sit on, which helps a great deal.  Regardless, it is a great tub, and worth it.",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub! It is great! My daughter moves around a lot and it has kept her in place! The only reason why I didnt give this a 5 is because it lacks something soft for her head.  I now put a washcloth behind her head but it would have been great if it came with a detachable soft pillow type object.  The plastic is just very hard and left her head red after the bath.  Other than that, its great!",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a wonderful bathtub for baby!  I have been using it with the Safer Bather since my son was first able to have baths.  The only suggestion that I have for this tub is that they should put a rubber or sponge padding in it.  When I put my son in it for the first time without the Safer Bather, he slipped all over the place and didn't like it (he was 3 months old at the time).  There's just no traction in it once you put the water in it.  So I ""downsized"" from the Safer Bather and bought a sponge pad. that I now use in it and he doesn't slide around anymore and can enjoy splashing around a bit (which he couldn't do with the Safer Bather).  He has always enjoyed his bathtime, but I know I would enjoy it more too if I didn't have to worry that he was going to slide around in it so much!",4,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub for my daughter's twins.  She loves the tub and the way the children sit in it.  However, her twins are still very small, 5 to 6 pounds and she says it is a little big for them.  It would probably work  better for babies weighing 8 pounds and over.  Other than that she says she plans to get lots of use out of this tub!  Very sturdy!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I will not waste your time echoing all of the fabulous things that have been said about this tub by others before me.  I give it 5 stars - enough said.  Many of the reviews are from parents with very young babies.  I'd like to give a perspective from a Mom with an older baby:I have used this tub since my son's very first bath.  He is now 18 months old and this is still the only tub that I've had to buy.  He still fits in it just fine, and I still use the lay back side to wash his hair.  Then we simply turn around to sit on the larger side to splash and play.If you're looking for a tub that will last you for the long haul, this is the tub for you. I'm not looking forward to giving up the security aspects of this tub when my son outgrows it.  I'll try to keep using it as long as I possibly can.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This is a wonderful tup for my little guy to bathe in.  It is quite large so that is my only negative.  It's almost too big to put into a bathtub but it does work great on a kitchen counter if you have the space. I can tell my little one loves it and is very secure in it.  I have had since he was a newborn and he is now almost six months.,4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"My husband begged me to get this! I said 'no way'. I had heard horror stories about how difficult it is to use, and that it doesn't really work. I also thought it was pretty gross to leave dirty, soiled diapers sitting in a room, even if the smell is masked. But he got it anyway. He ran out and got one when the baby was one week old.Now I am glad we have it. It really does work. It is a little tricky to figure out (I kept twisting the wrong part and cutting off each bag), but it is worth it. You can empty it as often as you wish, and you don't have to use it for the really nasty diapers. You can always run those out to the trash outside. It is pretty inexpensive for what it does!",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"very welcome item in our baby nursery.i have seen different versions of this product but just a note of caution. the hard plastic lid on ours had some very sharp edges such that i cut my finger reaching into the &quot;finger hole&quot; to open the lid. happened twice, nasty bloody cuts. we finally ended up sanding down the edge. besides that, it is easy to learn how to change the refills.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born. We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ. The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child. This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors. We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products. And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products. So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months. We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags. And changing the Champ's bag is very easy. But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable. It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids. So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie.  We have been using the Genie now for 2 months and very happy with the Genie. The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control. 1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism. 2) The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about 2 months now, we are very pleased. The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood. The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention. The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's. We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,But my husband wanted it on the registry.  And we both love it.  It is very convenient.  Contains smells unlike a regular garbage could.,5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I am pretty happy with my daiper genie.  I haven't tried other diaper pails for comparison, but this one does the trick, and helps control odor.  Its roomy enough that I only need to empty it every two or three days with size 3 diapers.  To help with odor control I spray with lysol each time I empty it.  It is easy to change the refills, but there is one ring inside that is difficult to fit in place when changing the refill.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I had no trouble using this product.  The directions are very clear and include pictures.  Our baby is one week old and going through diapers like mad.  This works great and there is no smell.  I bought this on recommendation from my brother who bought it 5 years ago for his eldest son.  They are now using the same one for their 3 1/2 month old.  Overall a great product.,5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love my diaper genie and there is no diaper odor, as long as you make sure the dirty diaper is completely twisted in its own little &quot;pocket&quot;. It fills up fast and you can run out of the plastic bag without warning. Also once you start a new &quot;train&quot; of dirty diapers, it's difficult to get the first one started through correctly. Overall, I love it and am glad I own one.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"we've been using this for 15 months with no problems.  though the retainer clip that keeps the cutter in the lid did just break off.  i think what works best for us, and keeps the cost WAY down on refills is to only use the genie for the poopy diapers.  the rest we toss in a lidded medium kitchen trash can.  a month or so ago, i filled them both with bleach water for several hours--they were beginning to smell.  but i think that's not so bad for 14 months of continuous use!  meanwhile, i just spray the inside of both with lysol each time i empty them.  i also just read a tip somewhere that wiping them out with a disinfectant cloth also works.so far, i may have changed the refill only 5 times or so. not bad!  i'm glad i got this as a shower gift!",4,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I have a wooden desk that seemed to be unchildproofable! I tried several different latch-style locks but nothing would fit because of the way the desk is built. I read some reviews on these Tot Loks and I have to admit I was afraid to buy them because everyone was saying that they are difficult to install.I bought some anyway. I found that they were EASIER to install than any two piece latch-style locks. With the latch-style, you have to do tedious measuring which I have zero patience with. Tot Loks come with little templates so, there is NO MEASURING involved!!My advice to anyone is to read the instructions over four or five times while sitting in front of your drawers or cabinets with all the pieces of the locks with you. After reading and looking for a while, I understood completely. I also suggest using some clear tape to tape down the template, especially on the side where you have to drill several holes. These take some time to install but, with a little patience, they are very simple and VERY effective! I'm glad I got them and I will be getting more!",5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,I FOUND THESE VERY HANDY WITH MY SON WHO HAS BROKE ALL BUT TWO OF THE OLD FASHIONED STLYE LOCKS. HE JUST YANKS THE DOOR OPEN AND BREAKS THE LATCH OFF.

WE JUST PUT THE MAGNET ON THE TOP FRONT OF THE FRIDGE SO IT DOESN'T GET LOST AND NO LITTLE HANDS (EVEN IF HE CLIMBS ON A CHAIR) CAN REACH IT.,5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I have tried and have seen other people try other cabinet locks. The tot-lock was wonderful. Even when my son gets a hold of the key, he just can't figure out how it works.",5,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"We have several different type of locks we use to baby proof.  These magnetic locks are very good about protecting little fingers and really keeping the kids out.  However, we chose not to install them on all the cabinets because of the little magnetic opener.  Our preschooler thinks its fun to take off with it, and if we store it somewhere out of reach, it takes way too long to open the cabinet to just get out toothpaste or whatnot.  In the kitchen, you can store the opener high on the refrigerator, but again, you must retrieve it every time you want to open something.We use these locks on some of the high-risk, low-use cabinets we have.  These include cabinets that store chemicals or sharp items like knives.  Overall, a good product for the right place.",4,1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I purchased this monitor to replace a more expensive one that we lost in a house fire.  I am very impressed with it considering the price.  It is quiet and I can hear more in this one than I could the more expensive one.  I have it sitting up on  a high dresser, my daughters bed is at least 10 foot away if not more and I can actually hear her breathing loud and clear.",5,1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I got this monitor to put in our bedroom because that is where our baby is sleeping until she is sleeping through the night and can go into the room with her older sister. I just wanted an inexpensive monitor to get us by until she was moved into her sister's room with our video monitor. This monitor turned out to be so much better than I expected. It picks up the slightest of noises, has been completely clear and we get great reception all over our house (upstairs and down) and outside. I can even hear the clock ticking through the monitor!!! I like it so much I'm going to purchase another one for our guest room downstairs so that I can nap the baby down there when I'm playing with my toddler downstairs. Great monitor for the price!",5,1

Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place.As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually.I also haven't had any issue with the straps and the lack of holes, since they are attached at the bottom of the pad and fit over the cover.",5,1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"After my 4-and-a-half year old, used every day, Fisher Price monitor started only transmitting static, no nursery sounds, I replaced it with a F.P.

I returned the F.P. and purchased the First Years Crisp and Clear monitor! Wow!  I get perfect reception all the time and it's so sensitive I can even hear my baby breathing.",5,1

"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I was so excited to receive these glass bottles after I learned about the potential harmful effects of Bisphenol-A leaching from my daughter's plastic bottles. They are so cute! They hold heat really well, and for a lot longer than her plastic ones. They also clean up really easily in the dishwasher which is heaven. My only gripe is that my daughter is 6 months old and is used to silicone nipples so she won't take the latex ones that come with the bottles. I did purchase some 'standard' gerber ones but they ended up leaking. Also the diameter of the nipple is a lot smaller than her old gerber comfort hold bottles so the way she nurses is different than on the new smaller nipples for the glass bottles. My advice is to start your baby early on this glass bottle/nipple combo or be prepared for some adjustment time as your baby learns the new one.",4,1
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","They are good except being heavy due to glass design but I guess it is expected. My boy is developing arm muscles now from holding it for few months now. hahaha. Three in a pack is a very good idea, four could have been better though.",4,1

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Used it for more than 4 months and still as good as new.

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","My son is 10.5 months and was on the variable flow nipple from about 6-10 months old so we could add a little rice cereal for his ""reflux"" (which turned out to be food allergies). At about 9 months (with no rice cereal) he started collapsing the variable speed nips.  On a frustrated whim, I ordered the fast flow ones.  Although they were rated for 6 months, I had to try something.  They are GREAT!  He's used them for about 2 weeks and he no longer collapses the nips and eats at a better speed.  Wish I'd thought of trying this sooner!  (As a note: My only gripe is that we do have to line up the nipples properly or they leak. But I had done this with his size 1 and 2 nipples when he was smaller, so knew immediately how to correct this.  So, I am still rating these 5 stars because they are serving my purpose.)",5,1

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",These #1 nipples are very slow!  All 9 oz. bottles come with #2 and too fast for a newborn.  I'm mixing #2 and #1 at week 4 and baby is adapting well.Just get some #1 and you should be set being able to poke holes to get to #3 and #4.,4,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","I went back to work only 6 weeks after the birth of my daughter and I believe the unique shape and anti collapse design of this nipple kept her from beconing confused and preferring a bottle.For moms who nurse, I would not recomend more than the two hole slow flow nipples, even with an older baby.  The slow flow rate makes them realize that the faster easier way to get milk is from natures source, your breast!  Even with the one hole flow rate, my daughter finishes off a bottle in 10 minutes flat, I don't worry that she needs a faster flow.If you feel that your older breast fed baby needs a faster flow, instead of going up a nipple flow, why not start him on the Avent magic cup?  The unique design lets babies as young as 3 months drink form a cup.  And the Magic Valve sippies fit all Avent bottles, so it's cost effective.",5,1

Playtex VentAire Bottle 9 oz. - 1 pk.,"I have tried the Ventaire bottles originally because I received them as a shower gift.  When I registered I shyed away from them because I thought that $4 was a lot of money for one bottle.  But, let me tell all of you looking to purchase the best bottle for your baby...Ventaire.  My son will eat will almost any nipple or bottle, but he gets really gassy, which leads to fussiness.  But, not with Ventaire.  He eats quickly, clamly, and gas-free.  Ventaire is the best bottle on the market.",5,1
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Hardest part was finding the wall stud - straps installed easily and are adjustable. We used it to attach a 6' bookcase in our toddler's room. Would definietely recommend these.,5,1
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"It took about an hour for me to install this - mostly because I was trying to keep my son from eating the screws. If he wasn't there, it would probably be about a 20 minute install. My only 'complaint' is that I had to use other screws than what it came with. This isn't really a 'complaint' for me, but I figured it could be for other people. Very satisfied with the durability and strength of this product. I am feeling much better about our dressers now.",4,1
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Now I a can leave my childs room without being scared that big desk going to tip over on them. I never had these growing up but I have had heard horror stories about dressers falling on kids. It is only couple bucks well worth it.,5,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We have owned the gate for just a few months, but so far it has been everything we had hoped for.  It is attractive enough to use in-between two formal rooms, it opens effectively and easily with one hand, and, most importantly, it keeps the pets where we want them to stay.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this product.",4,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this gate for our church nursery. So far it is working out very well. We have had other plastic gates that worked fine but were broken off the wall by kids hanging and swinging on it. The KidCo metal gate opens from the center so we are hoping it will hold up much longer and not be an enticement to kids swinging on the open gate door. The only negative for me is the tripping hazard of the bar across the bottom of the gate or threshold. I have seen other gates that have a threshold more like one in a home. This bar on the threshold takes some getting used to and could be a hazard for someone who is not aware of it's height. The childproof locking feature is a plus! If it lasts longer than our last two gates I would give it a 5 star rating but since we only have it a month, I gave it 4 stars.",4,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,So this gate's latch is slightly annoying but it did the job and kept my child off the stairs. Like this product and would purchase again.,5,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,Needed a gate for a new puppy.  This gate is very easy to install.  Pressure sensitive pads avoid any drilling requirements.  Gate feature is excellent.  Check opening width requirements to determine if you need any extensions.,5,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"Incredibly easy to assemble. This looks great and fits our door well. We use it to separate our cats and dog, but I'm sure it works well for kids, too :)",5,1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"After reading the negative reviews, there seem to be three camps of people who don't like the product.One group has uber-intelligent children, who figure out how to depress the button and lift up on the latch simultaneously, thereby allowing the child to escape. Tragically, while these children are mechanically inclined, they are not intelligent enough to resist the urge to pursue dangerous escapes.The second group is too unintelligent or impatient (as adults) to handle the exact same latching mechanism, or to step over a small bar. Hence they break the handle, and trip over the small lower anchor bar. This is tragic for both the parents and the children for so many reasons.The third group is deceived by the admittedly ambiguous instructions. You need to have this gate in a door frame or spanning between against two strong vertical surfaces. Then you need to crank the heck out of the compression ""bolts""  to ensure a very high degree of pressure. If you try to put it up against drywall, you will poke through the drywall. If you do not make the gate VERY tightly lodged, it will fall over, probably on your child as they try to climb on it.So, there are some legitimate problems with the gate. But, installed correctly and in a house of moderate intelligence on both the adult and child front, it should be just fine.I am of moderate intelligence, as are my offspring, and we have managed to make it work in three separate houses with only minor annoyance.YMMV.Update: Customer service was very responsive and nice when I needed to get a few replacement parts that got lost in a recent move.",4,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"works well for containing over zealous foddlers and puppies. the step peddle is wonderful when your hands are full. easy to use and install. Would be a 5 if the gate was another 5"""" higher.",4,1

The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best baby gate I've ever used or seen. It's very sturdy, and fits tightly in the 29"" entry way to my kitchen.  Despite my baby's best effort the gate doesn't budge a millimeter when he pulls on it.  The best part though is the foot pedal. It really does work hands free, just step down on the pedal and nudge it open with your knee. You do have to put a lot of weight on the pedal to open it, but this is good, because no matter how much a baby or toddler pushes or jumps on the pedal it won't open for them.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I am so at ease since I purchased this gate.  After purchasing the cheap wooden ones and the safety first gate i was extremely dissappointed.  My 12 month old daughter would rip it off the wall.  This gate is excellent.  It's easy to install,and operate and it helps block our bulldog from roaming the house as well.  Im going to purchase another one for my kitchen but i will need to order two extensions so that it fits the 44"" door way.  Worth the 49 bucks.  However they charge way too much for the extension kit. 14.99 for 5 inches and you usually need 2.  but there is no $ tag on safety.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We needed a gate for my son who is all over the place, what a great purchase. I even got the extensions for my wall. My husband and I think it was the best investment ever. Very easy to install. One thing about the gate that is really great, you don't have to put screws into the wall and damage your walls. That was my biggest concern. What an invention. Thank you to the company who made this gate.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I don't use it for baby's, but it keeps my dog in my office perfectly.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"As other reviewers have mentioned- great gate for kids. One thing I wanted to note: GREAT gate if you have cats. This gate stops children, but my 15lb+ male tabby can pass through an ever-so-slightly-larger gap on either side of the gate. Keeps baby out of the kitty litter room, but poor cat doesn't have to make any huge jumps. Baby and pet friendly!",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"First off, let me explain I only give 5 stars to great items!  This is a great gate.  We've had it over a year and its still going strong.When looking for a gate with baby #2, we wanted something our older one could open but the little one could not.  Now, this one has a foot pedal you have to push down on, and also push open the gate at the same time.  Its tricky for kids.  My 3 yr old neice couldn't do it, but my 4 1/2 yr old got it down pat with a few days of practice.  It holds up really well - she has to jump up and down on it and push the gate at the same time before it will open - it requires enough pressure to open where a younger child wouldn't be able to open it. (And if she just stands on the foot pedal, it doesn't move.  It needs more force).I love that its hands-free, just step down and use your knee to push it open. Its swings either way, and I love that it will stand open and not auto-close.  Sometimes you don't want it closed! It is sturdy - it stands up to being slammed 10 times a day by the older one and several more by me, plus being shaken by the toddler, PLUS the 40 lb puppy running into it and trying to push it open at least 4 times a day.I have found only 2 small complaints - 1) We have had to adjust it a couple times when the locking mechanism gets offset.  Honestly, I am pretty sure that is due to my older one slamming it in the same direction every time.  Its a quick adjustment with the plastic wrench and voila!  2) While it has not yet happened, I am concerned the knee knocker feature I love so much will become a place for the toddler to put his foot and try to climb over.  Of course, he won't be able to actually get over it, and really if a toddler is climbing that much any gate will be a problem. :)A few people have complained the swing-thru gate opening is smaller than other gates.  I honestly hand't noticed, and I have rather wide hips.  I clear it just fine.All in all, this gate is convenient, stylish, and takes a lot of abuse.  Well worth the money in my book.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have a relatively new dog who thinks my older cats are fascinating.  They don't feel the same way about her.  I got this gate for my home office so the kitties/I can get some peace when the dog is being a little overexcited.I have several other gates- the North (??) removable tension baby gate and the extra tall Carlson pet gate.  The North gate was fine but annoying to step over or take down often throughout the day.  This gate is taller than that and has the obvious advantage of a door.  The Carlson door is taller than this one, but that's about the only advantage for me.  The Carlson gate required being screwed into the doorway as the tension did not hold it in place well enough to withstand a dog jumping lightly on it.  The cat door on the Carlson wasn't good for me as my 35lb dog fit right through.This gate! on the other hand, is great.  The tension is sufficient to not screw into the door without preventing the door from opening.  The foot pedal works well- requires enough pushing that my dog is unlikely to do it on her own.  I love that the door swings both ways and locks easily back in place.  This door is also wider than the Carlson gate.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this gate.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"With two rambunctious dogs and a baby on the way I wanted a gate I could have my hands full and still open. This is perfect. My husband was skeptical about the foot pedal opening at first. But my 3 yr old niece came over, tried to get in the nursery and it wouldn't budge!! Love it!",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Product delivered on description.  Easy to use, install, and hands free.  It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.  Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.  I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.  In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We bought this gate to keep our toddler from going down the hallway.  It has been a wonderful tool and I highly recommend it.  The only thing that has happened is every once in a while the pressure mountings seem to get loose.  However, it doesn't take anything to tighten them up again.  The gate has never budged as far as coming lose from the wall.  We have been very, very pleased with this gate and it swings open and closed at least 200 times a day at our house!!",4,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate is incredible!  I have 2 older children (10 and 8)and &quot;back in the day&quot; I used the plastic tension gate and stepped (tripped) over it carrying kids, toys, etc.  This is so easy to install and use, HANDS FREE!  I am so glad we have this gate this time around!  It is quite sturdy:  my HUGE 12 month old grabs the bars and shakes and it stays in place. I can step on the pedal and the door opens easily with my knee. It is worth the extra few bucks to have the hands free convenience everyday!",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I just purchased 2 of these gates for my home.I have a nine month old that just figured out how to crawl through out my apartment. I have 3 doorways that lead from my dining room , kitchen and bathroom.  My husband and I have been looking for gates that would be sturdy enough for my little one's roughness as he gets older. With prices ranging from $30.00 to $130.00 we decided on these for 2 reasons, Cost and mechanics. I have to say I was really surprised out how easy they were to install. It was easy and counting 1 2 3.I love these gates because no hands are needed to open them.There great for moving from Kitchen to Dining room with plates in hand. I highly reccomend these gates for everyone.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This gate deserves a gold medal.  It was originally purchased to block off the kitchen from our 16 month terminator but proved its worthiness again as it keeps our new lab puppy in the kitchen.  It is also so user friendly. We are buying another one for the other end of the kitchen.  Don't waste your money on others!!!,5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Perfect for the where we needed it. As a high traffic area for carrying our son, we wanted something with a hands-free opening mechanism and the foot pedal/knee knock works great. It is also extendable but you need to buy the extension separately. More expensive than most pressure mounted gates but I guess that is for the hands-free operation.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"After browsing the stores for an infant gate, I thought they all pretty much left something to be desired. So, I chose this gate simply on price, fit, and the foot pedal. After reading the instructions and setting up The First Years Hands Free Gate, in way less than 10 minutes, I couldn't believe what an wonderful product this is. Very sturdy and works like a charm.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I have two of these gates. They open and close easily and hands free. They were easy to install. My only gripe is they are a little loud when you close them. My baby is a pretty heavy sleeper so it normally doesn't wake him up.,5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"for a gate with a door, this is the way to go. my only caution, truly, is in installing the step-plate. after seating it lightly in place, be certain to squeeze in its u-shape so all of the securing tabs slide smoothly into their respective slots. it's easy, don't get me wrong. we just lived for a few days with two of the tabs unseated, and i can see where the operation and longevity would suffer. also -- it's just the right height for a light hip-check to open; there is no knee-plate, regardless of the photos showing so (and there is no anti-trip ramp for the base, either, so just go ahead and add the really-does-work-like-a-dream tee-zed dreambaby no-trip gate ramp to your cart right now :) it has **saved** us.)",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I bought this gate about 2 years ago, when my oldest was one. It has held up very well and is very secure. Now 3, both her and her sister (1 yr) have been caught hanging from the gate. While this is not recommended, I was happy to see it hold up to the weight without breaking open.As for the construction, the bars and gate mechanisms are sturdy and well constructed. This is at the top of our stairs, contrary to mfg's specs, but we are quite happy with the level of safety this provides.One note as to why it is not 5 stars: every few months, I need to tighten the gate mechanism by using the provided wrench. I.e. the gate slowly loosens and becomes unhinged at the top. This is not a major safety issue, however, as you should notice the gate getting easier/looser to open long before it is a real concern.PS - it's nice to have this gate to teach kids that ""naughty puppies"" (dog who begs too close to the table or barks too loud) can get sent to ""puppy jail"" (other side of the gate). Makes for a good visual, too. :-)",4,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I used this gate for many many years, to keep children and pets out of my room.  Always worked great, especially the hands free part.  As far as top of stairs, not so good as with any gate.  Easy open going down but going up can be difficult reaching the pedal to open.  The best thing to do is put in a door and lock it to keep the young one from going down.  Toddles are really short people,  going up stairs by crawling works well,  going down can be a little more difficult but babies tend to overcome if that have to desire to get somewhere.  One more thought, when baby gets older and finds out that he can not open the gate then he may find a way to stack things up to climb over and that is the big thing about gates at top of steps.  That is way they tell you not to put them at the top of the steps.  Enough said,  do not give the item or Amazon 1 star,",5,1
Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier - Navy,"I couldn't wait to use this product once my daughter was born!  She was too small the first 3 weeks (under 8 lbs and 21&quot;), but now that she's grown, we use it all the time!  The head support is great for when she's tired and just wants to be carried around.  It allows me to do so many things around the house when she's awake and have her with me so I don't feel like she's being neglected by just laying her down or putting her in her swing.  It gives you hands free, but close bonding w/baby.  Although expensive...it's WELL worth the price!!!  It's safe, fun, and easy to use!  I recommend this carrier to EVERY parent.",5,1
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack","The Breast shells arrived within 10 days of ordering.They were a bit bigger than I imagined but very soft and comfortable. Absolutely suited the purpose of supporting the nipple after reconstructive surgery for one very flat and one inverted nipple. The surgery gave me a fantastic result and I didn't want to compromise it.The shields keep the nipples protected from clothing rubbing across them as the nipples can be a bit hypersensitive after surgery. The protective nature of the shields feels really comforting.The shape of the shields is very good and they are worn inside the bra you usually wear. Not the best for clothes with finer fabrics or light colours as they look a bit pointy but the look is fine with a darker t-shirt or a jumper.After this type of surgery it is also important to massage the nipples regularly with a sorboline type cream as scar tissue can form around the incision areas at 9, 6 and 3 o'clock, and this can sometimes affect the final result. I'm in my fifties. My husband is a G.P. I'm so glad I had this surgery. It was nothing to worry about,took about and hour and a quarter under light anasthetic and recovery was unremarkable.I wish I had had it done years ago. I'm glad my husband found this product online.",5,1

These are in my view far superior in design to the O-cal-ette (which has a hole where the milk will leak out), because they have no hole for the leak to milk out, well actually they come with two cups, one with holes, one without, and we use the one without. Great. Also they're apparently comfortable enough to put on while feeding.However!These are not 5 star because... they don't hold enough milk! So we are still wondering if we can find such a product which will fit inside a bra in similar way, but passively collect a larger amount of breastmilk.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack",Very good product as Well as useful. I like everything of this product. I world recomend it to moms with newborns.,5,1
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack",EXCELLENT,5,1
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Navy Carrier,"I first bought a sling (which my daughter HATED) and I had another less expensive, complicated front pack, which the baby liked, but killed my back.  I work in a Dr office and the baby comes with me to work, so I often have to &quot;wear&quot; my baby.  The Baby Bjorn is soooo comfy for both me and my now 6 month old baby.  It is so worth the extra money.  Don't waste you time and money on other carriers.  Your baby and your back will thank you.",5,1
SafeFit Car Seat Leveler,car seat leveler was so simple to use. the car seat is very secure using this. and looks very neat. nothing hanging out. i highly recomend this product.,5,1
Gerber Knit Crib Sheet ~ Snug Fitting Soft Jersey Knit,"As a soon to be second time mom, there is one thing that I have learned when it comes to crib and bassinet sheets - knit is better!  They are much softer on baby's skin, plus, my son used to get a rash where his skin pressed up against &quot;regular&quot; sheets.  Anything spilled (or drooled) on a knit sheet during the night absorbs more easily and is less likely to irritate baby's skin, as well.  Just feel the difference between the two and ask yourself which one you would rather have on your bed.  Gerber sheets are excellent quality for the price, as well.  I highly recommend these sheets!",5,1
Gerber Knit Crib Sheet ~ Snug Fitting Soft Jersey Knit,"I have two of these crib sheets, in addition to a more decorative sheet that came with my crib bedding set.  These sheets fit my mattress perfectly and are ultra-soft...perfect for baby's bare skin.  To describe them better, imagine what your old, favorite t-shirt feels like...  Also, they're easy to clean.  If the sheets get stained (and they inevitably do), I just spray them with some Oxy Baby Stain Remover and throw them in the wash...and they're perfect all over again.I highly recommend these sheets for anyone who needs a couple to spare.  Besides, you can't really beat the price either!",5,1
The First Years Pooh Pacifier Attacher,The product was cheap and easy to attach to my sons' onesies.  I liked that this was not a metal pacifier attacher.,4,1
SoftShells Breast Shell Soothers - Sore Nipples,"I used these breast shells in conjunction with the Avent Nipplettes to help my flat nipples become more everted before the birth of my son. The breast shells are great for keeping your clothes from knocking the Nipplettes off, but they're also great for when you've taken the Nipplette's off and your nipples are still too tender to have your clothes rubbing against them. Since I'm still pregnant and not dealing with milk leaking issues, I can't attest to abilities of the foam to absorb extra milk. I'm very glad these were recommended to me, though, and they've been great to have around.",5,1
SoftShells Breast Shell Soothers - Sore Nipples,"When I brought my daughter home from the hospital I already had sore spots on my nipples.  They turned to scabs and then when the scabs got soft in the shower, they came off leaving gaping holes in my nipples.  I fully understood the words &#34;nipple trauma.&#34;  I was using silicone nipple covers which helped my sore nipples from sticking to my bra, but I didn't feel like they were getting any air circulation..  The soft shells gave me the air circulation and allowed the Lanolin to stay on (not rub off), which I think helped me heal.The other huge benefit of the soft shells for me was to catch leaking milk.  In the beginning of nursing, I had an abundance of milk.  The breast I wasn't nursing would leak at least an ounce on let down.  I often filled the entire soft shell and it leaked out of the holes at the top.  I started putting the silicone covers over the holes so the milk wouldn't leak out during let down and then I could go empty it in the sink.  I had previously been stuffing a burp cloth in my bra, but everything still got soaked.As other reviewers stated, when I wasn't nursing, I found the soft shells did put some pressure and caused me to leak slightly.  When you bend over to pick up your baby (or something else) the milk leaks out of the holes at the top, which can be frustrating.After breastfeeding was established, and my let down wasn't so strong, I learned to apply pressure to my breast on the side I wasn't nursing during let down (pushing with the palm of my hand slightly in and upward) and this kept that side from leaking and losing that milk.I used the soft shells for several weeks and overall, I felt they were helpful in letting me heal, protecting my nipples from sticking to my bra and allowing Lanolin or other topical cream to stay on longer, the shape of the shells were decent and could be hidden under a baggy shirt, and it was great for catching excess milk.",5,1
"Evenflo Home D&eacute;cor Wood Gate, Natural Oak","Good gate. Everyone comments on how nice it looks with our decor. Took awhile to install but once up seems very sturdy. I struggle with the safety lock, but it should be fine once I get used to it.",4,1
Infant Flight Vest Travel Harness (Red),This harness was easy to set up and kept our 4 year old (30 lb) child safe on our recent flight. It was so much easier than a car seat on the plane. She could not open the chest strap to fool around or get in and out of her seat. She just sat securely for the flight!  A must have!  I know we will use it with both of our kids and will recommend it to others!,5,1
Baby B'Air Toddler Flight Vest - Red,"Although I had read that some people weren't allowed by the flight attendants to use this product, I had no difficulty on either United or Southwest. No one bothered us about it, even during take-off and landing. The vest itself was easy to put on my 10-month-old, and gave us a little more peace of mind during turbulant conditions. It was especially nice to have it while nursing our daughter. I only wish I had gotten the smaller size- although our daughter was in the weight range for the toddler size, her shoulders were smaller than the head opening. I would recommend people err toward the smaller size when choosing this product.",4,1
Baby B'Air Toddler Flight Vest - Red,Works great for the hyper social toddler on a plane.  Label says not yet FAA approved/ reviewed so your not supposed to be allowed to use at takeoff/landing. Flight attendants never said a word.,4,1
Medela 12 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,Married mom of a 3 yrs old boy and infant boy.  This product allows me to pump on the go so that none of my boys are neglected of my time with them.,5,1
Medela 12 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,So far very happy with this purchase. Has great suction and was a better deal than buying it in-person.  I use it with my Medela Pump'n Style Advanced.,5,1
Medela 12 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,"It does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car.  My wife used it on a cross-country trip we took and it basically saved our lives.  Well, not our lives, but it does work.",5,1
Medela 12 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,This thing saved me. I had to go back to work when my little girl was 6 weeks. I do home health so I'm always on the car on the go. I don't have a break room that I could go pump. So this was amazing.,5,1
Medela 12 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,"Powers the original Pump in Style from your car charger.  Note that it will pump a bit faster than when you run off of the AC adapter.  However, if your car battery is old or weak, the speed will vary considerably (presuming that you do this while the vehicle is moving.)  In that case, you might be better served to buy all of those AA batteries and use the battery pack instead.",4,1
Bugs On Board,"I keep these bugs on the handle of my son's infant carrier seat.  He was about 5 weeks when I got them and only 9 weeks now. He still can't pull on them or even bat them yet, but he loves to look at them in the car.",5,1
Bugs On Board,"When I bought these bugs for my 2 months old boy I anticipated him to get attracted; but his reaction exceeded all my expectations. When he saw these toys hanging on his bouncer he said his first ""Wow!"" :-) Or, whatever he said, definitely meant a big Wow. I had never seen him that excited before. My little man was even more attracted when he discovered that the bugs have crunchy wings, they rattle and the dragonfly buzzes. Toys came in different colors then shown on the picture; but they look even nicer.  The size is perfect also: enough to attract an infant's attention, but not too big so he can hold them easily. He can spend 30 minutes or even more kicking these toys, touching wings and even talking to them! The bugs became his best friends - and mine too because, while he is busy with them in his bouncer or crib, I can spare time for some homework.",5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,My daughter uses this step for everything from potty training to 'helping' me in the kitchen. She loves it. It's easy for her to carry around and also very sturdy...no sliding or tipping.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,I have a very high bed and I'm very short.  I use this little stool to get in and out of bed.  Works great and seems very sturdy -- sturdier than one of those small plastic folding stools I used that broke very quickly.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,My 2 boys love this stool because it is easy enough for them to  move around and feel independent. I like the non slip on the top and bottom of the stool,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"Nice nonslip surface and feet make it safer for the little ones to reach the bathroom sink. It is a little short, but I'm not sure higher would be as safe anyway. Gets lots of use from my 2 & 4yos.",5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"At first I didn't like this step as it wasn't tall enough for my then 2 year old son to get to the toilet seat on his own. At nearly 3 years old, he can get up-and-down from the toilet seat on his own, but he's still not even close to reaching the faucets on the sink. However, after several near miss falls on a small, sliding two-step Rubbermaid ladder, I realized that the BabyBjorn one is a safe choice. And I like the way that it looks too and the fact that ours was made in Sweden (I believe it's now made in the USA).",4,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"This stool is not decorative, but it does what it is intended to do. I also have the cute, wooden step stool type of stool, but I needed a stool for a small bathroom where function took precedence over form. What I really liked about it was that it had a non-skid botton as well as a non-skid standing surface (others like this in this price range do not).",5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,I bought this with my Bjorn potty chair.  It's nice and sturdy.  Very pleased with the product.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,I bought this with the bjorn potty seat. It is just ok. I wish it had a wider or better grip on bottom. It's small and compact which is nice for the tighter bathroom downstairs and doesn't get in the way. Overall it does what it needs to do.  If our 2.5 year old feels like she missteps she usually grabs the wall for stability. In our bigger bathrooms upstairs that guests do not use we got a step stool that went half circle.,4,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,I bought this for my 3 year old to use in front of our elongated toilet.  It gets her to the perfect height and is very sturdy.  I am using it on a tile floor with large tiles (12x12) and haven't had any issues with it moving around.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,What more can I say?  It's cute and it works.  It's plastic and so buyers can expect that this stepping stool will not be as sturdy as something heavier and made of wood&#8230;but it's sturdy enough.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"We've owned this for 8 months so my son was 30-38 months old when using it. He has been 29-32 pounds in that time and uses it to get up onto a potty and then moves it over to get up to the bathroom sink. It has not once tipped over. After reading some of the reviews on Amazon that cite tipping as an issue I tried to tip it over. The non-skid material on the bottom of the stool grips the tile floor well. I couldn't make it even begin to tip when trying and my son has never fallen off of it.After reading all of the reviews about tipping, I would not buy this stool. Given my own experience though, I think it works well for a 30+ month old, 29+ pound child on a tile floor.",5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"Can't do a thorough comparison to other stools, but glad I got this one!Pros:Right height for my daughter to get up to the toilet and sink.Good non-slip footing on top and bottom.Arch is perfect for an adult foot to slide it in and out of place.Cons:A bit pricey for what it is.",4,1
Medela SoftShells for Inverted Nipples,"I was given some of these at the hospital when I delivered my baby as we were having major latch issues.  They worked so well that now we are exclusively breast feeding and no longer need to pump and use the bottle two weeks later, or one of those annoying nipple shields.  My only problem was that if I didn't wear them e.g. at night as Medela suggests then the nipples would get flat again, so I purchased an extra set and wear them all the time.  Wearing them 24/7 did cause some irritation initially but breast milk solves everything, and I make sure to air the area out after every feeding and keep them clean and now this is not a problem.  I hope with longer use I won't have to wear them all the time.  I also find that as long as I don't wear anything low cut then nobody would know I was wearing them, I am not on the huge side so I don't know if that makes a difference.  As an additional bonus they are a built in catch for leaking milk.ETA: at 6 weeks pp I no longer need to wear the shells so much, they have done their job and now I am wearing them for maybe 8 hours per day. Still love them!",5,1
Fisher-Price Crawl-Along Drum Roll,I bought this for my 6 month old daughter and she loves it.She was just learning to crawl and would chase it all over the living room.  She is fascinated by the blinking lights and music.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a baby just beginning to crawl.,4,1
"Philips AVENT Soft Spout Magic Cup, 9 Ounce, Twin, Color May Vary",These sippy cups are the best for my daughter who like to flick the straws and take other sippy cups apart. I like that these are easy to clean with few parts and impossible for my daughter to get to leak. I'm very happy with these.,5,1
Boppy Nursing Pillow -Colors Vary,"This item was a gift, so I am unsure how to rate the exact product, but ordering and shipping worked out great!Thx",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I absolutely love this.  My daughter never wants to be put down, she loves to cuddle and with the bjorn carrier, I could nurse her and she could fall asleep.  I could put her in and out of the carier without waking her.  I tried every single carrier on the market.  I spent hours in Target and other stores trying different carriers.  This maybe the most expensive carrier on the market, but it is sooooo worth it.  I don't have a single complaint about it!",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,I am one customer that had bought numerous carriers&gt;  I thought that there is no difference in the carrier and all I would pay for was the name brand.  I loved the way Baby Bjorn's carrier looked but I was not happy witht he price.  But as I bought carrier after carrier I spent about the same amount of money for three carriers and I was not happy.  I convinced my hubby to buy Baby Bjorn and I was so happy.  My back never hurt and my baby was comfortable.  I carried my son almost until he was a year old...then he had to go.  But I was so greatful for this product.  I even found an old beatup carried in a department store. Someone used it well.  I gave both my carriers away to other moms in need and now I am pregnant again with my third child and I will not hesitate buying another Baby Bjorn carrier.,5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"My daughter loves this carrier. It is comfortable for both of us. It allows me to get some exercise by going for walks, run errands easily around town, and keep my hands free doing chores at home. Since she has colic, it has become an essential part of our daily routine. It is worth the money!",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"Wow, what would I have done without my Baby Bjorn carrier?  This is TRULY the only carrier worth spending money on.  And although you're spending a little more than what some of the others cost, you DEFINITELY get what you pay for!  This is the only carrier that fits securely on a woman's or man's body comfortably for you and for baby, with as little strain on your back as possible (keeping in mind that the human body can only carry something around for so long before it starts to get tired...)  This is definitely a &quot;must-have&quot; for those first few months at least.  I was able to get housework done when baby didn't want to nap but needed to be held close.  She still got the attention and &quot;snuggling&quot; she desired and I got the dishes done!  Mommy's happy, baby's happy, what else do you need? Get this one for sure!  You'll be so glad you did when you need to get things done and baby needs you, too!!",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I too was put off by the price tag of this item, but after going through three less expensive carriers, I finally broke down and bought the Baby Bjorn. I wish I had bought it sooner because, due to my procrastination, I was only able to use it for a couple of months.  It was well worth the money and both my son and I loved it for the short time we were able to use it. Make sure that when you do buy a carrier, you do it right the first time and buy the Baby Bjorn.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"My daughter never wanted to be put down and with housework piling up, I would put her into this carrier & she would just love it! This carrier is very cozy and has a lot of padded suport for both you & your baby! It never felt uncomfortable to me and I always felt that my daughter was safe & secure in it. This is a little pricey, but will last you a long time & a great quality!",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"We love this carrier. Our little one has been strapped to our chest since she was tiny, and at seven months it still beats dragging the stroller around. Its especially helpful because it'll usually put her to sleep; the walking motion is comparable to how she was carried in the womb.The only time I revert to using a stroller is if I'm headed to the mall to try on clothes. That's the only time I've found it inconvenient - though still managable.Some people wonder if it's uncomfortable and tough to carry the baby in. This carrier is far superior to the others I've tried out - the back straps are very supportive and if you use it right it distributes the weight for you. I've never had a backache from it - but I certainly have had a backache from carrying her around without wearing it!All in all, this is a great product and well worth the money.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I never thought I would need this, but when I got pregnant, my sister said that a carrier/sling is an absolute MUST.  I put this on my Baby Registry, and received it as a gift at one of my showers.  My daughter was born 6 weeks early, so she was quite tiny when I put her in the carrier the first time.  She was so small that her eye level was where the arm holes are!  Regardless, she would quiet down when she was put in it.  Now she &quot;fits&quot; in it correctly, and she absolutely loves it.  I use it all the time....-I use it when I go shopping.  It leaves my hands free, and my daughter perfers it over being in a carrier.-I use it at home especially if I am trying to get house work done, and she's a bit fussy.  I can put her in the carrier, and she quiets down almost immediately.  I can vaccum, do dishes, dust, all kinds of things, and she's so content.-I use it when we (baby, rottie, and myself) go walking.  It's easier to have her in the carrier than trying to push a stroller and handle a rottie at the same time.-I use it just to calm her down.  When she's fussing, I put her in the carrier, and she just calms down.A great feature of the carrier is that if your baby falls asleep in the carrier, you can undo the carrier without waking the baby up!So, if you're shopping for a gift, and you want to be remembered ever time the gift is used, buy this carrier.  I think of the person every time I use this, and I am so thankful.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This carrier has been so helpful to us!  My daughter grew out of her infant car seat/carrier at 4 months old which was a bit of a dilemma for us when we went grocery shopping. She was not yet old enough to sit up on her own in the shopping cart so we needed something to keep her safe and keep our hands free. This carrier was the answer!!!  She is now almost 6 months old and we are still using it (with her facing out).  My husband also likes to use it when he takes her for walks on the trail behind our home.  It is really comfortable, I have never had a back ache from using this carrier and my daughter is now 18 pounds. It adjusts with ease for the babies height and for the height and weight of the adult as well.  With a simple pull of the two straps it conforms to your body.  I am 5'4"", 112 lbs. and my husband is 6'2"", 240lbs, and we are both able to comfortably use this carrier. Our daughter loves it too, she is so quiet when she is in there and seems very comfortable. I know it is a bit pricey but in our opinion Baby Bjorn is the way to go!",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I was hesitant about purchasing this carrier versus the less expensive models out there.  But the Bjorn has earned its keep in our household.  My son is now 4 months old and is happiest in his Bjorn.  It's great for mall trips, grocery shopping, walks around the neighborhood even when he's fussy while we're entertaining or eating at a restaurant.  I love having him close to me and he loves getting a bird's eye view of everything I'm doing.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,I got this item as a baby shower gift. Being a first time mom and w/ no research done into carriers I had no idea what a good rap this item had.  I really never used it at the beggining.  But when it came to going on a trip by myself and dealing with the airport and luggage I can say it did it's job.  I didn't give it five stars only because I didn't use it that much and really didn't put it through other &quot;tests&quot;.,4,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,This was the best gift I could have recieved. It was so useful. I was able to carry baby while doing laundry and dishes and was able to carry her while going to the mall and store etc. She loved this and boy it was so easy to use.,5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I love this carrier!  I still use it &amp; my daughter is 9 months old.  We started using it when she was about 2 months old &amp; she is so happy in it.  Your hands are free &amp; it doesn't hurt your back.  I do grocery shopping, exercising, etc. while wearing it.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"We received this carrier as a gift at a baby shower after our son was born, and it's by far the best carrier we've used.  (We received a few other carriers as gifts and purchased one ourselves.)  From the level of comfort for baby &amp; parent you can't beat it.  One carrier had a tendency to slide off one of my shoulders.  Another carrier was comfortable for me, but difficult to get baby in and out of without causing a fuss.  If he fell asleep in it, there was no getting him out without waking him.  The sling just never worked for us, due to lack of real instructions and an inability to get baby in a position that was comfortable for him.But the Baby Bjorn is a dream as carriers go.  I consider it the next best thing to my own two arms for carrying my son.  getting him in and out is very easy and after a few minutes he gets accustomed to it.  It's very comfortable for the parent as well, and can be worn without risking a backache later.  Best of all, I can get little things done around the house (tasks that take 15 - 20 minutes tops), especially if I put him in the carrier after he's just been fed and changed.If we hadn't gotten it as a gift I would probably have been put off by the price, but now that I've used it, I have to say it's worth the cost.  You get what you pay for, when it comes to baby carriers.",5,1
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This was recommended to me during my pregnancy, but when I saw the price, I decided not to purchase it, because I considered it to be a ""luxury"" item.  THEN came the baby, and I decided I needed something to carry her in so I didnt have to drag the stroller in crowded places such as Wal-Mart or the grocery store, where you also have to push a buggy.  The Baby Bjorn carrier is WELL worth the money and then some.  It is comfortable and very user friendly.  Spend the extra money and you WON'T be disappointed!",5,1
Diaper Genie 3pack Refill,"I have the old model Diaper Genie and am sooo glad to have one!  A few comments:1. Some people claim the refills are too expensive. We get them at WalMart for less than $5 each and each one has lasted more than a month, even with a 7-month-old who poops like it's an Olympic sport. $5 a month is worth it for the convience of not having to change it as much as you would with a garbage bag - which are probably about as expensive.2. Some people say it smells - I can't believe that.  Even with our baby eating solid foods and making hideously stinky poops, there is NO odor in our nursery.  Not even a little!!  I empty it every 7-10 days and there is never, ever an odor coming from it, even when I am sitting next to it playing on the floor with the baby. UPDATE: We switched to the Toddler strength or Stage 2 refills at about 9 months as he started to eat more ""real"" food - still no odors!I love that the Genie is easy to use, easy to empty and refill and that there is no smell at all. We don't use it for wet-only diapers and I would recommend it to everyone with an infant.",5,1
Seal 'n Go Breast Milk Bags,I purchased this bags because they were cheap. I have been using the first years bags which were ok.I freeze them flat saving lots of space! Just make sure they are correctly sealed and freeze them lying on top of a napking so they don't stick to the freezer.Pros:- great value- can freeze them flat and they don't leak (just make sure they are closed correctly)Cons:-the plastic of the gerber bags is a little thinner than the ones i used before.-they are not very stable when you stand them up.,4,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple, 3 Pack","i bought the dr. browns bottles when my daughter was 2 weeks old after i had tried about 6 others. the bottles work amazing and ssince i've been using these, my daughter who is now 5 months old, doesn't get gas at all! now with the level 2 nipples she is a happy camper!",5,1
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Bottle Starter Kit,"My son was born seven weeks early, and was bottle-fed in the NICU.  When he came home, we had a few frustrating days trying to find a bottle he liked.  These bottles are great!  They are the only ones I could find that offered a preemie nipple.  The other bottles drowned him, but these were just right!",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I have in my cupboard: Tommee Tippee, Playtex Ventaire, Phillips Avent, and the new Similac brand bottles. I also tried Dr. Browns with my firstborn, but Hated them.  I will preface that my babies were exclusively bottle fed, so there is no breast to bottle compatibility issues here.  Also, none of the bottles had leaking issues- the following comparisons are on a 'all else being equal' basis.Tommee Tippee:  Only 3 pieces.  The thing I didn't like, is they are short and squat shaped, so I can't balance the bottle with my chin during a feeding if I need to free up a hand briefly.Playtex Ventaire:  5 pieces.  My only complaint is that the neck is very narrow, so every time I make a bottle, I spill powered formula all over the counter.  I believe they make a wide mouth version though.Phillips Avent:  4 pieces.  There are so many measurement ticks, that it is too hard to read.  There are tick marks for mL, UK oz, and US oz.  And between each whole ounce mark is a sideways teardrop shape marking, but the rounded fat side of this is about 3 millimeters in size, so where the heck am I supposed to fill to- the top or bottom of this round shape?Dr. Browns: 7 pieces.  Two of these pieces need to be cleaned with a pipe cleaner so they are absolutely not dishwasher friendly.  Biggest complaint- the measurements are not in marked in paint, they are clear raised up bumps.  Imagine stumbling to the kitchen at 3am with your eyes half shut and trying to measure a bottle by tiny texture bumps only!Similac:  3-4 pieces.  The stir stick part is optional.  In my opinion, the perfect bottle.  Ergonomic shape, clearly labeled measurement ticks, wide neck... works perfect for me.As I mentioned, I did not have any trouble with leaking.  I also didn't have trouble with my baby not latching properly or not liking any of these.  This review is pretty much strictly from a comparison of the design standpoint.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","These bottles are wonderful. We have never had any problems with feeding, she drinks just fine. The newborn nipples were too slow for her, so we just got the next stage a little earlier. They are easy to clean.Only complaint I have is that traditional bottle warmers don't work well with these because the bottoms are removeable. It took so long to heat up one bottle that we just started making a new bottle almost every time, or sticking the bottle in a bowl of hot water.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","Really like these bottle and so does my little girl, she use to have colics but these seemed to help. now she is use to these bottle and will only take these. she loves em",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I used these and the advent bottles for my daughter and now am using these for my son. The Advent nipples are actually to soft for him and he ends up with more down his face than in his mounth.  Anyway, I must have missed that note about not to use in a steam sterilizer.  I always put them in my Advent microwave steam sterilizer and have never had any problems with them, they didn't dry out or anything, so I am not sure what the issue with the steam sterilizer is. It is important to stretch the bottom piece to make sure the holes are open after every cleaning. The main thing I don't like is that they don't have replacements for the bottom part of the bottle.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I used these bottles with my son who was very colicky. They seemed to alleviate the colic all together. They are very easy to wash since the bottom is removable, you will never again have to scrub at the bottom of a bottle to get all of the formula out. When we traveled with these bottles we loved them even more! The desing and no air in the bottle means that when tipped upside down no milk leaks out the nipple! This is a huge plus. Also I never had the problem of the vent at the bottom getting clogged,what are they talking about?",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I think Playtex has changed their bottles, so I was trying to find the ones I originally had but the 9 oz bottles instead of 6 oz. I searched on Amazon and found the ones I love. I am not real sure why Amazon changed the bottles, but I love these sets.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I've read the other reviews about babies getting gas from these bottles and about the bottles leaking. First, every baby is different.  For some the cheep bottles work and for others its the more expensive ones. Also, the kind of nipple your baby prefers are different...mine liked latex.  As far as the leaking bottles, I think all can leak from time to time.  Maybe its because they got warped in the microwave (which you should not do at all) or maybe there not on right or tight enough.  I'm nursing my 4-month old but time to time I give her a bottle and these bottles work the best.  Mine only leak when I don't have it on right, which are very easy to put together.  This bottles does have 6 parts but you don't have to clean every part after each use.  I usually keep the bottom part screwd on and wash it all in the dishwasher.  Don't take my word for it...try out a couple ( maybe a friend of yours has some bottles you can try so you don't have to buy a lot) and see which one your little cutie likes : )",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I sarted using these bottles when my daughter was 6 wks. old. I tried other bottles, mostly cheaper ones, and my daughter would be so fussy after eating, have formula all over her, and spit up everything shortly afterwards. I switched to these bottles when I found out my daughter had acid reflux. I had to add cereal to her formula so the Stage 2 nipples worked perfectly for the situation. She is now 12 months and I still use these bottles. I have switched the nipples, yet again, to the Wal-Mart brand and they still work, no collapsing or leaking. These really are great bottles and will definately use these for my second child.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","They are great bottles when used with Gerber's slow flow nipple.

I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THEM.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","First and foremost I love that these are BPA free. That is very important to us in this house with all our plastic products.

Playmobil 5719 Nativity Set,"My 4 1/2 year old daughter and I love this toy.  She has been busy acting out the christmas story and putting the pieces just so to match the photo on the box.  My one complaint is that Mary's headpiece won't snap onto her head, so it just sits there loosely.  I'm not sure why some parts come put together and some we have to snap together (or not in this case...), I've always thought that to be a little weird about playmobil.But, overall, a very nice toy.",5,1

Safety 1st 900 Mhz Sight And Sound Nursery Monitor System,"When I was researching a video monitoring system, I was pretty turned off by the reviews I read for this product. My sister-in-law has the Baby quiet sounds by Summer Infants. Hers worked great, so I decided to get the Summer product instead of the Safety 1st. When we got the Summer monitor home, there was nothing but static and rolling picture.  We literally turned off every appliance in the house to try to get it to work!  NOTHING worked. So, we returned it and bought the Safety 1st sight and sound video monitor.  I was not very confident that it would work, but I thought it was worth a try. Well, to my amazement, the Safety 1st Sight and Sound video monitor works great!  There is absolutely no interference.  Even in total darkness, we can tell if baby has his eyes open or closed!  So, if one product does not work for you, try a different one.  Apparently, the different brands must be sensitive to different types of interference.",5,1
Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,I searched everywhere for these valves because my daughter liked to lose them... Super cheap and exactly what I needed!,5,1
Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,"So glad Amazon has this for sale! I couldn't find replacements anywhere! These get gross, eaten up by the garbage disposal, or just plain vanish. New cups are expensive, so glad that these are offered. Playtex cups are THE BEST when it comes to preventing leaks.",5,1

"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Navy Trim","This support can be used in almost anything (bouncers, swing, and strollers).  I bought it to use in my Baby Jogger stroller and it works wonderfully.  There is actually a Snuzzler designed specifically for Baby Jogger which costs more.  This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost $15 less!  I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby's head forward, so I removed it.  But she was already 3 months old when I bought it, so it might work well for newborns.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","we bought this for my daughter because we do a combination of breast feed and formula feed. This one is more natural to other bottles we have used before and also the ventaire technology is simple yet amazing. our daughter used to get a lot of gas with AVENT bottles but ever since we switched to these she did not have any problems. Also you dont have to burp her as much, very minimal amount of gas actually goes in while feeding.i recommend this product to every parents.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","When I first saw this, I was sure that it would leak, but it just seemed like such an innovative idea that I bought one anyway. The bottle is incredibly easy to clean because both ends can be removed.I unscrewed the nipple ring and the bottom of the bottle. I was so sure that it would leak if I put anything liquid in it. I filled the bottle full of water and tossed it around on a white sheet to see if it leaked. It didn't, but I still wasn't sure. So, I washed the bottle in hot water. I've noticed that some bottles leak after being washed. Then, I tried the sheet experiment again. It didn't leak. This bottle is 9 months old and still hasn't leaked.I also liked how these bottles were wide and took similar nipples as the disposable bottles from Playtex, which makes switching back and forth from the Playtex disposable and reusable bottles much easier and causes less nipple confusion.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I first started using the playtex nurser, in which you dispose of the liners but i noticed the that the 8oz bottle were maybe being filled to 7 oz or a little more. with this problem i would have to refill the bottle and give my baby her last 2oz. MY husband did some research and found that playtex made these. well i absolutely love them. They do not leak. If you place the bottom ring right, you will not have this problem. also my daughter was sufferring from gas when she was a newborn and this helped to alleviate the problem.Now for the problem of sometimes the bottom ring being lost somewhere. you can simply call playtex and they will be more than happy to send you a couple of replacements free of charge and they also send you an order form and the cost i believe was like 2 rings for $1.00.i really like this bottle as it does not leak and it is very easy to clean. other bottles leave that white film in the creases. NOT THE PLAYTEX you get into every crevice.you do not have to deal with bags which can be costly for a few people that they go recycling the liners which is very unhygenic and nasty.i recommend this bottle over any other. my friends were even disappointed with their avent bottles that they ended buying this playtex.also this bottle is a great transition from breast to bottle as my daughter did not notice a difference.i hope that anyone who buys this bottle is happy with their purchase. but please keep in mind that if u rush in putting bottle together and do not place ring correctly you will be bound to get leaks.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",Great bottles. Helped with going from breast to bottle. No issues. Just make sure you have the plastic part in correctly or it will leak.,5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",I love these bottles.  I'm a working mom who is trying to breastfeed. My daughter has not got nipple confusion yet and doesn't seem to have a problem with gas from these bottles.,5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I tried every type of bottle out there.  I wanted to make sure my son was getting the best he could get.  I tried the gerber (the plain old bottles with the normal bottle and nipple with ring)--which were horrible.  I tried the Dr. Browns (those babies don't fit in the dishwasher well, and the nipples got greasy for some reason).  Then I got a set from bzzagent.com and found out what I was missing.  The whole playtex line is nice.  I like the standard size nipple better (is closer to what my son is used to with the dr. browns) so my favorite bottle is actually the regular, narrower ventaire bottle.  But I have a few of these with the natural shape nipple, and he likes them too.  He has no problem with getting the formula out, and doesn't appear to have to work any harder with these bottles than another.  Mine have also never leaked.  I've washed them in the dishwasher and in the sink.  I've had no problems.  In fact, my FAVORITE part about these bottles... with dr brown's you need 4 hands at night.  I feed upstairs where surfaces I'm working with consist of the bed, nightstand and crib.  I prefill 3 bottles with water and use a separated container for the formula.  If I use the dr. brown's, you have to unscrew the nipple, pull out the tube assembly, hold them while you attempt to dump the formula in.  and where's my screaming baby during all this?  Usually in my arms or lap.  I've dumped formula all over my sheets, spilled the water on my mattress, etc.  These bottles have the same number of parts total (to wash) but they're soooo much easier!  You just unscrew it like the regular bottle and go!To be honest, I can't say that there is a huge difference in my baby's gas or burping with these bottles versus the dr. brown's.  That's okay, though, because his gas is awful with any other bottle!  :)",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",These are the only bottles our baby would take.  They are wonderful especially if you switch between the breast and bottle often.  Wouldn't use anything other than the Playtex Advanced for my child.,5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",After trying every nipple at the store our son finally decided on this one. Since the bottle is bent it is easy to have the baby eat every last drop. The only downside is that the printed oz markings wear off within the first few weeks. I found that if you put clear tape over the markings it will help protect them.,4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I tried these bottles hoping my baby would like them but unfortunately, she still refused to accept them over the breast. She did use them a few times though and didn't have a problem with excess gas or anything.I think the nipples were a little hard but most silicone ones are. We traded to some Playtex latex nipples, which fit perfectly and were softer, more like the breast. She actually drank 4 oz out of it with that nipple.I like that they were different colors and easy to clean because the bottoms come off. I would recommend these to others.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",One of the best bottles i have tried for baby reflux. The only (and important) information that's not clear is about the nipples flow type (fast) included.,4,1

"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","Being a first time parents, my husband & I weren't sure which bottles to use. We registered for Avent (which leaked all over our daughter, made her gassy and spit up alot), Gerber (also made her gassy and spit up more) and our third try were the Ventaire. Finally a bottle that worked great! She doesn't drown while eating from a leaking bottle, she spits up less and has less gas! These are the best bottles around. We also use a microwave steam sterilizer on them and they are fine. First, we wash them with the bottle brush and hot soapy water, then sterilize them in the micro and they come out great! I highly recommend!!!",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","This is an excellent product that works as advertised.  The bottles don't leak, they're easy to clean, and the nipple is much better than most other baby bottles.  They also have a nice shape and they look pretty nice too.My one major complaint is about the way the product comes packaged.  It does not include extra nipples.  Basically this product gives you three 9 ounce bottles for about $12 (current price).  For only $20, you can get thePlaytex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, which includes FIVE bottles, several extra nipples of different sizes, extra bottle caps, and extra vent disks.  The newborn starter kit is a much better value.  On the other hand, if you just want a few bottles plain and simple, this is definitely the product to buy.  Very pleased.",4,1

Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"I LOVE this bottle warmer.  I can do everything right at my bedside, so I don't have to run up and down the stairs.  It holds two bottles and keeps them cold throughout the night, and I keep a bottle of water beside it to fill the little water vials.  You put the water in these pre-measured vials, and when it's time for your little one to eat, you pour a vial into the warmer, drop the bottle in and turn it on.  In about a minute, you have a toasty bottle for baby!  I used Gerber, Avent and Medela bottles, and all worked perfectly.  I recommended it to my two sisters-in-law, and they loved it for bottles and baby food jars, too!",5,1
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"I have owned this bottle and have used it for my daughter for the past 6 months without a single problem. I have researched every single bottle warmer out there and I can tell you, with confidence, that this is the best you will find. The removable cooler is very convenient with the fact that you do not have to go rooting around your fridge in the middle of the night looking for the bottle, plus it holds two bottles. I use Avent and it works perfectly. It also makes it very convenient to place right in your baby's room! My sole complaint is that the nightlight is not bright enough alone. But the steps to use this are quite simple. First, fill the resevoir with the premeasured water amount, then add the bottle and just press the button to start the warming process! It's just that easy! I have left this device with my family and they have mastered this product within a few uses!I hae noticed many gripes about this product and my response is, READ THE MANUAL!!! As long as you read and follow the instructions in the booklet, you will perfectly okay! The steps are not tricky at all, but there are a few little tips that they give you in order to keep your unit running properly.",5,1
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who uses Dr. Brown's bottles - make sure to take the cap and tube off the bottle when using the warmer!  I wish I had read this before I had boiling formula leaking all over the place!  I do not know what it is about the Dr. Brown's bottles, but if you don't take off the cap and tube, they WILL boil over.  And it STINKS, not to mention that you've wasted formula, and created a nasty mess.Even with this issue, we have been very happy with the warmer.  A lifesaver if you have a 2-story - it's so great not to have to go down to my kitchen every night - especially since my son still gets up twice in the night to eat.  If you follow the directions on how much water to use, the formula ends up at just the right temp.On the whole a great product, I just hope you other Dr. Brown's users out there read this before trying to figure out why your bottles keep boiling over!",4,1

The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"I bought these spoons for our first family vacation with a 9 month old. We were gone 5 days which included a 12 hour drive there and back. These spoons were great!! The size was perfect, they were sturdy and not flimsy or cheap like an adult disposable spoon. And the price was great to be able to feed him either in the car or at a restaurant and just throw away the spoon and not worry about washing/rinsing them and re-packing them. I will definitely purchase these for any future vacations and will even keep spares in my diaper bag in case I forget to pack his normal spoons.",5,1
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"You can't beat the price.  I purchased these to take with me on day/ weekend trips.  They were cheap enough so that I wouldn't be upset if I ever lost one.They are much sturdier than I expected for something considered &#34;toss-able.&#34;  I have washed these in my dishwasher twice already and they are holding up great.  There are no unsightly scratches or discoloring.My pack arrived with blue, green, purple, yellow, orange and PINK spoons.  I have a daughter, so, it was a pleasant surprise.The size is perfect for my 9 month old daughter's little mouth.  I have a 3 year old and although it is on the small size for him, it is still large enough for him to get enough food on the spoon and into his mouth.  I would not recommend these spoons for children over the age of 2.The product arrived at my door in 5 days.",5,1
Baby In Sight Mirror,This is my absolute favorite item!  It is so great to be able to glance in the rear view mirror and see what my little guy is doing!  Is he awake?  Sleeping?  Fussing?  I can tell in just a second.  It's also great because he can entertain himself just by watching himself in the mirror!,5,1
Baby In Sight Mirror,"I originally bought the Elmo mirror, but it was too small. This mirror I hooked on the seat behind my daughter. I could see her and she could see me. We both loved it.

Prince Lionheart Stove Guard,"This stove guard works great, easy to attach, and is a must if you have little ones with octopus arms.

The First Years Car Rear Sunshade,"This sun shade really helps. Our son cries when the sun is in his face too much in the car, so having the screen up makes the car experience much more pleasant for all of us. The screen doesn't cover the entire rear window though (thus 4 stars). It's pretty easy to see through for visibility.",4,1

"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I really needed something to warm my baby's bottle without using the stove or microwave. This was to my surprise faster and easier than any of the two, makes my job a lot easier. I would recommend to busy mothers everywhere.",5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","This warmer is small enough to go back and forth with my daughter to her sitter's every day in her diaper bag.  I would leave it there, but my husband uses it if she gets hungry and Im not home from work yet.  I get a brown residue on the bottom, but I attribute that to the water quality, because I get it on my steam sterlizer, which is a different brand.",4,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","After reading everyone else's reviews, I was nervous to try this product.  Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.  Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",4,1

"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",Bought this as a second warmer to keep at grandmas house to make life easier... Was hesitant because of how cheap it was but was so glad I got it!! Would be a pain to fill the little tube with water everytime if it were the primary warmer at home but as a secondary it's wonderful. Is great for all bottles and use for food and have steamed passies in it when they fall and I don't have a back up with me!,5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I read the reviews on this product and several others.  I decided to buy this one and I am glad I did.  During the day I don't need it because I make the formula on demand.  Before we go to bed I make 2 bottles of formula and refrigerate it.  When our baby wakes for those 1 AM and 6 AM feedings, I grab a bottle out of the fridge, throw it in the warmer, grab the baby, change her, and when we are ready for that bottle, it is perfect!  Just the right temperature.  I use the Evenflo bottles with mine, which work great.  I, like the other buyers, have had to learn just how much water to add, but when you get it down pat, it works like a charm.  I highly recommend this unit.  It has simplified our lives and made those early feedings so much more pleasant.  Love this item.  It was well worth the purchase price and the convenience is worth that and more.",5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",i bought this product just before i had my daughter and i found it to be excellent. It worked really well to heat up both breast milk and bottle milk. She is six months now and i could still heat up food and other items for her.....great product...,4,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","Quick and easy to use, you just have to be careful not to burn yourself with the steam. Other than that it's perfect, my wife loves it.",4,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",I haven't tried the product yet as my baby isn't born. But it seems to be a good product with good quality.Shipping was fast too.,5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I gave it a 5 star because i warms just like you would warm a bottle on the stove. It heats pretty fast, i just always take it early but i think it really depends on how cold the bottle is (i have to warm room temp bottles as well or my LO will not drink it!)& the amount of water you use. So follow the instructions!",5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",this is great so that my daughters have the items that they use at home here when they visit me.,5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",I have the From Dusk To Dawn warmer which is wonderful but is to big to carry the whole thing back and forth from the kitchen to the bedroom at night and vice versa. That's why I bought this one to keep on the kitchen counter for daytime feedings.  I am so glad I did.  This is a great warmer!  Its terrific design holds ANY kind of bottle PLUS includes a special basket to heat baby food jars.  The water vile is transparent and has lines so you can customize and remember the perfect water level for the amount of formula your heating.  The &quot;on&quot; button lights up when it is running and shuts off automatically when it is fully heated. (My 4 yr old son even tells me when the bottle is ready)  Its also nice and small so it doesnt take up much room on your counter.  I'm very glad I purchased this product.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,Bought these because we were using a Medela pump and Philips bottles. Of course the breast pump and bottle industry can't make it easy for everything to work together. These adapters fit great onto the pump and the Philips bottles. Don't feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work!,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,I have a Medela Lactina (Hospital Grade) and use these religiously. I am so happy to have the best of both worlds - using Medela pumping system with Avent Bottles for breastfeeding! This makes my life so much easier and for the price - its priceless!,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,"My wife uses these just about every day for a Medela pump with Avent bottles, works great.No leaks, and removed the need to have to transfer between the Medela bottles and Avent bottles.",5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,"I purchased this kit in order to use my AVENT natural bottles with my Medela POS (insurance provided). They fit perfectly and I have not experienced any leaking. Now I no longer have to transfer pumped milk and lose drops of my &#34;liquid gold&#34;...I just pump straight into the bottle, seal it with ring and sealing disc, and put it in the fridge. No extra bottles to wash!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Formula Mixer,This is such a great product... it has the right amount of power to get the job done quickly and easily.  The battery lasts a long time (though it mixes faster with fresh batteries it still does the job even when it starts to slow down).  I can't believe it's priced the way it is.  I've had mine for 6 months and have recently added two more to use for other purposes (like protein shakes and such).,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Y-Cut Standard Nipple, 3 Pack",My son has reflux and the doctor said to put some rice cereal in his bottle. These nipples have helped me to do so. It took my son a couple of tries to understand not to suck too hard because he was getting more but he's a pro now!,5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","Dr. Brown's bottles are simply the best.  We tried Playtex Premium nursers with the drop-in liners the day we came home from the hospital, but my son would not accept the nipple on the Playtex bottles.  Luckily we had some Dr. Brown's Natural Flow  bottles (NOT wide-neck), and they were a success on the first try.  Dr. Brown's silicone nipples were very similar to the nipples that the hospital used on their nursette bottles.  After five weeks of being formula fed using only Dr. Brown's bottles, my son has yet to spit up so we are firm believers that these bottles work.  NOTE - We purchased 4 oz. bottles, but I would recommend ordering 8 oz. instead b/c after four weeks, we no longer use the small bottles b/c our son is already up to five ounces per feeding.  :-)",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","Wow.  We had a tough time with a colicy baby. Dr Browns bottles are the only ones that didnt leave my son burping and spitting up over and over.  They are a good transition from breastfeeding too.  I tried Advent, Johnson and Johnson and Gerber (Gerber was the worst...my son sucked the nipple inside out and at the same time milk was escaping out the side of his mouth) and none of them compare to the excellent quality of Dr Browns.  It is worth the extra time it takes to wash them.  Our son is now 7 months old and we try not to use any other brand.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","Lots of parts, more to clean. And that's the only down side. On the pro column,  these bottles produce almost no bubbles, does not leak when used properly, and my baby has an easier time with the nipple. Consequently, my baby now suffers much less from gas, feeds more comfortably and more quickly. He sleeps better,  much less hiccups, much less grunts/groans during sleeping. Finally, I feel better for him. A happy baby makes for a happy me. My baby was not latching well to the Avent nipples - not a bad product, but the gap between his lips and the Avent's firm silicone nipple caused milk to drip down his chin every time he feeds, the same gaps allows air to sip through and get ingested by him - and as a result, he experiences gas pain after almost every feeding. If your baby can latch onto the Avent nipple properly, then he should have no problems with it. The Avent still offers the most complete bottle-feeding system on the market today. At least, I think so. For now however, my six 4-oz Avent bottles are going to the storage and will later be used to serve Gerber-type baby food. For milk, the Dr. Browns are it.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","I bought a starter pack of these bottles due to the fact my daughter spit up alot of other bottles we tried. We now use these, and she can actually sleep after taking her bottle. I know they take longer to clean, but it is worth it if you have a happier baby!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",I was given one pack of these bottles at a gift at my shower. They looked really confusing to me but thought I would give them a try. My baby almost never had gas. They cut the air right out of the bottle and he loved the shape of the nipple. These are a must have especially with a colic or fussy baby!!,5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","This is truely an excellent product. I had to write to agree with what everyone else is saying.Our baby simply do not swallow any bubbles no matter how we hold the bottle. We would not feed from bottles unless it's got the Dr. Brown insert in it.The way it works is that there's this this vent tube inside the bottle which lets air escape from the nipple. What you get is that the entire nipple area is filled with milk/formula, no matter how fast your baby drinks. Baby can not suck air from inside the nipple. Period.Baby can still suck in air from outside the nipple, but that can be fixed if you get a wide mouth nipple that forces the baby to close her lips around it. End result is baby won't have any gas problems.The vent tube can be used in other bottles so you can have more options.The vent tube is something extra that needs to be washed, but that's just a minor inconvenience.The nipples that comes with these bottles are not the ones we want to use, but who cares, we just toss them and put in a different nipple of our chosing.I got the 4 oz bottle now, I'm definitely planning to get the 8 oz versions when the baby's a bit bigger.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","These are a must for any parent!  I used to think a bottle was a bottle.  Was I ever mistaken.  After two months of the baby screaming for hours at a time I thought I was going to have to go to the mental hospital.  The doctor said that this was normal.  Yeah right...  Mom said, I think it is your bottle.  She is getting air and it hurts her belly.  I switched to Dr. Brown's bottles and never looked back.  She doesn't scream in pain anymore and I feel like a normal person again.  These are the best!!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","These are so much better than the other brands we bought. We bought the very colorful, bent bottle, vent flow ones and they leaked, were hard to get suction going, caught so much air that the milk looked like it was cappicino froth, and our baby had so much gas then. She would get frustrated trying to eat and it took longer. Now she eats faster and has much less gas. Plus you can see there is no froth. The travel disks prevent leaking and we are much happier!",4,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",My baby was 6 weeks premature and had difficulty breastfeeding.  The problem was compounded with the bottles the NICU used to feed her - the nipples were fast flowing so my baby got lazy and didn't want to suck very hard to get her meal.  When I got her home I continued to practice breastfeeding with her and then used the Dr. Brown's bottle to feed her.  After only three days she developed the sucking skills and strength to breastfeed.  The Dr. Brown's bottles are wonderful because the Level 1 nipples simulate the flow of breastfeeding and the bottle reduces bubbles by pushing air to the back of the bottle.  The only drawback is the extra parts you'll need to clean - small price to pay if you're having breastfeeding problems!,4,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","You can't go wrong with these bottles.  I am a first time mom and love to use them.  My son is still breast fed, but when he gets juice or water, I give him the Dr. Browns bottles because he sucks barely any air.  With other bottles, the nipples collapse and it never happens with the Dr. Browns.  There are a few extra parts to clean, but it isn't a problem and doesn't take that much more time.  Would recommend these bottles to anyone and have heard friends rave about these bottles too.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",Dr. Brown's were recommended by a friend and they were the best baby item recommendation we got from anyone. My baby almost NEVER spits up! I burp her after she eats but I usually don't even get anything out of her. These bottles are the best you can get!,5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",I started my baby out on these bottles.  He does not spit up at all and when he burps it is usually right away.  These bottles don't allow air to enter the baby's tummy.  They have replacement nipples for each stage and I have found them to be especially useful now that he's 4 month's old because I can use the Y-Cut nipples and give him just a tad of cereal in his bottle at night before he goes to sleep and it makes him sleep longer because he doesn't get so hungry.  He doesn't like eating it off of the spoon yet.  Never have had any leaks and they clean easily.  I would suggest buying the 8 oz. bottles though because you don't get to use the 4 oz. too long before it's time to go to a bigger bottle.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","My firstborn had no problem with plain old cheap supermarket bottles, so we used the same for my daughter when she started daycare at 3 months.  Her daycare providers reported horrible first days of crying and gas, so we tried the Dr. Browns, and they said they made all the difference.  (I nurse when she's home with me, so can't report that first hand.)My beef with them is that they leak, even with the little plastic disk inserts that are supposed to prevent leaking.  This is a pain, because no matter what, the bottles are going to tip over in a bag at some point and make a mess.So, if your baby has gas problems, by all means try them.  But don't turn them upside-down!",4,1
DEX Automobile Baby Bottle Warmer,"I am so glad I ordered this.  It makes heating a bottle so convient in the car or trailer.  This is for a grandchild, but what a wonderful item.",5,1
"Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple, Slow Flow","I was initially hesitant to go with Evenflo, we had used Dr. Brown's with our first child (they were pre-BPA scare bottles so we trashed them).  I'm pleased to say that these nipples (and the glass bottles) work just fine and don't seem to give my little guy any trouble with air.  Highly recommended for a budget conscious family!",5,1
"Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple, Slow Flow","My husband asked for the most straightforward bottles and nipples we could find and the evenflo is it.  We have had no problems, but the additional nipples rates are a must for older infants.",5,1
"Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple, Slow Flow",These nipples worked perfectly and wore well.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Never developed any stains either.  It helped that they came in different sizes for varied flow.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Dome Caps,Perfect replacement for the lids we lost! Exactly like the ones that come with the bottles which we managed to misplace. These lids are awesome because they actually seal off the tip of the nipple to help prevent spills. Our Dr browns bottles had lids that didn't keep the milk from leaking out.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Dome Caps,"I really love those caps,it came out so much handy and easy to clean .Highly recommend.Two thumbs up for all Avent products!!!",5,1
"Gerber First Essential 6 Pack Silicone Nipples, Fast Flow",I have cats.. and they like to get a hold of the nipples when I leave a bottle out so I need to keep buying these. They work perfect for a few different bottles I use & are in expensive!,5,1
DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"My daughter is 17 months old and has Cerebral Palsy.  She has difficulty eating and the Dex Baby Food Processor has allowed us to provide a tastier variety of foods that she loves.  My daughter enjoys fruit baby food from a jar but won't eat veggies or meat from a jar because of its bland taste and thick texture.  The food processor allows us to blend our meals into smooth portions for her.  Some of her favorites meals include chicken and dumplings, spagetti with meat sauce, mixed veggies and chicken teriyaki noodles.  I can't say enough good things about how much this processor has helped my daughter eat a balanced diet.  THANKS!UPDATE:  My daughter is now 3 1/2 years old.  We continue to use the DEX Baby Food Processor daily.  We cannot say enough good things about it-- it is so easy to use and we quickly transform our tasty chunky meals into tasty smooth meals for her.  It has never failed us and the blade has never needed to be sharpened.  It is our number one kitchen tool!  We highly recommned it!!!  July 5, 2008",5,1
DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I tried this before my baby was born and I like it.  I needed some fresh fruit for my 6 month old niece.  She was having bowel issues I was told to give her fresh fruit in stead of jars.  It did not take long the food to look like the stage 2 foods in the store.  I saw the blade goes up and down to try to get all the food.  I defiantly recommend this to any one who want the best food for there baby.  Home made food is so much healthier for babies than jar stuff, in my opinion.I saw in some reviews that people did not like this processor because it would only chop foods like carrots, apples and pears.  I would like to make a comment to that.  Check any cook book and in order to puree any of those foods you need to boil them first.  So please don't use that review for your opinion.  Would you eat veggies with out cooking them first!  Take what you make for your table and then put it in the processor for the baby, and add a small amount of milk to make it softer!",5,1
DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,I think that this food processor is a bit small for when you want to do big batch of food but I love it because :1. It gives a really smouth purees2. It's easy to clean (diswasher !!!)3. Usefull even with toddlers who are not always comfortable with meat.,4,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,My 15 month old baby loves these nesting cups. They will entertain her up to twenty minutes at a time. I purchased these because I needed five more dollars for free shipping. Glad that I found them.,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,Cute cups for the kids to play with.  Make great bath toys.  Colors are nice.  I would buy as a gift in future,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"it is very colorful and sturdy. my grandson loves to stack them and throw them around, which proves how durable they are.",4,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"We bought these when my son was 6 months old. It's a year later, and he still loves them. He is able to figure out a million ways to use these cups and they are always a go-to toy for him. I highly recommend them.",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,Bought them for my son when he was about six months old.  He loves them.  Easy for him to grasp and stack.,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,my grandbaby is learn to reach and i hand cordination so this product realy helps her with that task stacking and kicking them over is her favorit thingt to do! ty kisha,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"My baby loves these cups! (6 months). Right now she just likes to chew on them and throw them on the floor and watch them spin, but I am excited that she can still learn to stack them later. I like that each cup has little shaped holes (stars, hearts, triangles, etc.) according to the number it says on the bottom of the cup. Great price especially compared to other brands!",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"We were given two sets of this toy.  We kept them both.  My daughter loved the toys!!  She chewed them, stacked them, learned her colors and played with them in the tub.  They do have holes in the bottom for safty reasons , she would fill them up with water and the either pour it back out or watch it come out the holes.",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,Our 9 month old goes for these simple stacking cups out of all toys nearly every time.  Perfect for the price!,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"My son is 18 months old, an age when toddlers are known for having notoriously short attention spans, but he won't stop playing with this set! He makes a game out of placing other objects (toys, crayons, etc) into the cups then emptying them and starting all over, or he'll test how high he can reach by placing the cups on a table/counter, then returning for them later. When he's not playing with the cups on the floor, he'll walk around the house holding the three biggest cups (his favorites) in his hands wherever he goes. Overall, a great, yet simple toy product! Highly recommend.",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"My daughter really loves these stacking cups. She can easily stack up and nest them with ease and they can be played with both in and out of water. I love them because they are super sturdy, can be washed when needed, take up little space, and are bright. But most importantly, I love these stacking cups because my child can actually stack them without them tipping over, unless she wants them to. Some stacking cups are not steady and it causes toddlers great frustration when they are trying to stack a tower and it falls midway. The First Years Stack N Count Cups are really one of the best stacking cups out there and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a simple toy that will provide multiple options of play and will last for many years to come!",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"so cute, each cup has a little shape punched into the bottom.  my 12 month old loves playing with these.",5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,"I picked these up on sale, and was not expecting much from them.Turns out my son loves them and I do too. They are portable (easily fit into a bag), quiet, don't break when thrown on the floor, and still hold his interest after months of owning them.Amazing how something so simple can be so entertaining.",5,1
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,"This pinch guard goes on easy (and comes off easy on the rare occasion that we want to close the door to our playroom).  The kids used to play with the door so much we talked about just taking it off.  Someone was always getting their fingers pinched.Since we got this they actually stopped playing with the door all together since it won't close.I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little thicker  - if it was it would also be able to prevent the hinge from closing on little fingers too.Overall, it does what it says it does, for a good price, without being permanent.",4,1
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,"This product was perfect. It did exactly what I needed it to. I purchased it because my toddler is very into slamming doors shut. Not only was I terrified about her pinching her toes, fingers, limbs, etc, the noise was startling and extremely loud. It helps me keep her safe and keep her from potentially locking herself in her room. The foam has withstood a great amount of squishing and slamming and has no marks, dents, or missing pieces. They have held their shape. I also like that I can put these on any point of the door. We put them on the top closest to the hinges most of the time and it keeps her door propped open in  a way. We will be purchasing these again for other doors in the house,",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"Although my son, now 6 months, has never had any problems with colic, he just loves these bottles.  He is now a total bottle snob, and won't take any other kind.  The few times I have had to use another kind, I notice he does have more air and more spiting up.  They are great for formula or breast milk.My only complaint is that they do leak when you travel.  The white cap helps a bit, but be sure to keep it upright if you are going to travel.I would highly suggest these bottles - even though they are more money, you will be glad that you spent the extra.",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I have tried them all.  These are the best bottles available.  They make feeding a pleasure for the baby and the parent as well. Absolutely no bubbles, and no collapsable nipple. Really not hard to clean, just a little bit more effort.  Stick with these, do not opt for the wide-neck version; they are not nearly as wonderful for reasons I have mentioned in their own review. We are very satisfied with these and would recommend them to anyone!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I had my kids 10 yrs apart, and had used Evenflo GLASS, yes I said Glass bottles with my son (1993).  He forever power puked at least 1/2 of his formula up, but back then there were nothing other than baggie bottles, and those were just as bad!  So this time I really did research bottles! (2003)  Dr. Brown's are the most fabulious bottles ever, they are so easy for the baby to breath instead of gasp for air!  Nahdia barely even needed to burp till she started taking a full 8 oz.  Not EVER did I have ANY spit up problems with her!  These bottles really last too...  she's used the bottles for 13 months now, and they're still going strong!  Even with using the microwave and dishwasher!  INGENIOUS!  Thank you Doc Brown!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,I have twin daughters and started out with this product because of raves and recommendations from parents at our local ER where I am a registered nurse.  The bottles work great.  My daughters hardly ever spit up which saves on clothing stains!  They have never had a problem with gas.  It is definetely worth the extra time it takes to clean the bottles and the money.  I don't think I would use another brand!,5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"At 8 weeks old, my son began to show signs of reflux, we took him to lab after lab getting tested but nothing was ever conclusive.  But he constantly threw up after feedings.  His doctor recommended that I try to find some bottles on the web that suited my son's needs.  One day, got a flyer from Babies R us, that had the Dr. Brown starter pack on sale.  I figured why not try it! Boy am I glad I did!...the vomitting decreased to less than once a week! Instead of solving one problem, I found these bottles solved a MULTITUDE of common problems, he's never had colic, he's never had gas, and my son is now 18months old and I can proudly say,  he has NEVER suffered an ear infection NOT EVEN ONCE!!!!!  My cousin's son was 9 mos. old, and was always being treated for ear infections, I told her to try Dr. Browns, her son is now 20 mos. and has not suffered an ear infection since!  These bottles don't get proper advertisement!  They should be on Billboards!!!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I began with Avent bottles.  My baby constantly would spit up and suffer with gas bubbles.  I was introduced to Dr Browns by a friend.  After using this bottle, my daughter hasnt had trouble with gas and hardly ever spits up.  Cleaning all the pieces is so worth the time!!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I am the mother of premie twins.  I registered for several other brands of bottles but when we brought the babies home, they had a very difficult time with the larger nipples.  My husband actaully went out and came home with Dr. Browns and we haven't looked back since.  Although there are several parts to the bottle, it is worth the extra minute or two is takes to wash and assemble the bottles.  Dr. Browns bottles are excellent!!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"My daughter had to go the the ER in the middle of the night, due to gas.  I went out the next day and bought the Dr. Brown bottles, and with-in two feedings she was back to the happy baby she was before the gas started.  I have been using them for 4 weeks, and although the extra pieces can be a pain to clean, its worth it.  I just bought a bunch of them so I only have to clean them once a day.  I really can't say enought about them.  They have made my little girl so much happier.",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"My baby was on medicine for reflux before we tried these bottles!  Once I learned how to feed a baby with reflux, and used these bottles for a little while, her reflux was under control and I only administered the medicine when necessary -- she was off of it by the time she turned 3 months!  Before, she couldn't even sleep in her bassinet -- she had to sleep in her bouncer because she was in so much pain!  I hardly gave her gas drops, either.Yes, the parts are a pain in the patootie, and they will MILDEW if you do not wash them at least 12 hours after using them (speaking from experience!), but I saved myself time in going to the pharmacy, administering drugs, and cleaning up spitup.  I just stock lots of extra bottles!  And I would make a batch of formula in the morning and load my bottles -- the doc said it helped with gas.  Just take it out 10 minutes or so before feeding time.",5,1
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I had tried playtex disposable bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners kept filling up with air once I put the cap on the bottle or I had spills.But Dr. Browns have saved the day. I love the way these bottles look, perform and how my son passes his gas easily. Great purchase, I loaded up on nipples the other day for when he needs a different flow. Worth every moment cleaning and sterilzing! I rather have a happy baby then a fussy baby.",5,1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Disposable Bottle Liners, 4 Ounce, 50 Count (Packaging may vary)","After washing a gazillion bottles, I was given the playtex drop-in system as a gift. Wow, what a time saver! I LOVED not having to wash the whole bottle every few hours. I did feel a little guilty about the waste, but I eased my mind by putting the liners in the recycling bin. I loved the 4 oz because in the beginning, my baby ate at most 4 oz and so it was less waste.",5,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural","I was very impressed on how fast it was delivered, in less than a week  - product was well packed.It doesn't look excatly like the picture, there are some visible ""bolts"" and the finish is alright, the bolts look ok with the style - the greatest feature is the fact it doesn't close automatically so it is safe for children, which is what I need.It's good for a kid room but I would not put this in a living room as again the finish is not great but for the price, I can't complain - overall I would recommend it for a kid room.",4,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural","I almost didnt buy this based on some of the negative reviews. Glad I didnt heed their foolishness. Well made, all parts were in order, simple assembly (only 20 fasteners total).",5,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural",I love this box! I wanted something to store my daughter's toys in and have the freedom to paint and customize and it fit the bill! The lid is brilliant because it wont come crashing down on fingers (actually it gives quite a bit of resistance to close) and baring human Doh! tenancies it's easy to put together and strong and sturdy.,5,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural",I was very satisfied with the quality and completeness of this product.  It was very easy to assemble(done mainly by a 5 year old).  Shipping was very quick and well packed.  I would definately consider ordering another toy box or other items from this company!,5,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural",love the way the lid stays in place where it's placed. dark finish goes with alot of different decors. Ended up using for blanket & throw storage.....need another for toys! lol,5,1
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural","This is a great toybox. However, 3 pieces came damaged. replacement of the pieces was easy - you order it online. The pieces came damaged because not enough protective packaging was used. Nonetheless, once all the replacement pieces arrived, it was easy to assemble.",5,1

Leachco Bath 'N Bumper - Cushioned Bath Tub - Blue Fish,My one year old grandson had outgrown his plastic infant bath tub and we were looking for something to use in a textured tub as all bath mats seem to be made for non-textured surfaces.  This works great -- he's comfortable in it and it doesn't move around in the tub -- has a hook to hang it from the towel rod to dry.  He loves bath time!,5,1
CHOU CHOU Changing Backpack,"My four year old daughter received the changing backpack for Christmas along with the bouncy seat and feeding set.  The backpack is very good quality, although I feel a bit pricey (but grandma bought it).  She uses the changing pad as a doll blanket.  The backpack fits the feeding set inside along with the other accessories.  The best thing about it is she loves to change her doll's diaper and the blanket matches the bouncy seat. The two zippers on the backpack are very easy for her to use.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","The Leachco safer bather is wonderful.  It fits in my kitchen sink and is nicely padded for the baby.  Because it is so firm, I can put my baby on her tummey and wash her back very easily.  The bather dries quickly after the bath by hanging it up.  I am very happy with it.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We bought two different baby baths before trying this product, and I wish we had just skipped to this. You don't have to worry about the baby sliding, or fitting into the right spot, plus other baby baths keep them up out of the water. With this product, you have complete control over how submerged your child is. My son is 4.5 months old, and we've been using this for about 2.5 months. He is much more comfortable and relaxed on this pillow than he ever was in a baby bath or the sink. It's perfect for us because we have a small house and small bathroom, and it doesn't take up much room. If you don't squeeze as much water out as you can before you hang it to dry, yes it gets a little mildew-smelling but no big deal. After using daily for a few months, the fabric that holds the plastic hangar is starting to unravel but I would guess we'll be able to use it for a year or so before we need to try to repair or replace. It was a great deal.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",We love this bather for our son as a newborn.  We put it right in the bath tub with a little water and he was comfortable and easy to wash.,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","this is a great washing tool for baby.  i wouldn't dream of using anything else.  since the umbilical cord fell off, my baby has been using this in our adult bathtub.  he doesn't slip and is comfortable lying on this.  he enjoys feeling like hes taking a bath even though the water level doesn't come past the point of the mat.  this is probably good up until baby can sit up and move around on their own",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",My newborn screamed through his baths until we ordered this and began to use it. Now he LOVES the bath! What a relief... This is the best bathing help I have found. It holds him securely so that I can scrub away. Keeps him warm and cozy the entire time.,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",This bathing pillow is the best!  It keeps baby warm and is very comfy.  My baby loves it - she can still kick around in the water while her head is elevated.  I highly recommend this product for babies that are not sitting up.,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","I bought this for my daughter when she outgrew the infant bath (around 4 months old) and wanted more room to splash and kick. She loves this! It makes it feel like she's in the big bath, but she's safe in the water. It can also be a great item when its dry just for keeping baby in one spot and able to play with her toes, etc.  I highly recommend it!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Our son LOVES taking a bath and it's worry-free for us, thanks to the Safer Bather.  This leight-weight bath pillow is perfect for baths in the kitchen sink or inside another tub.  Although our son still fits in the kitchen sink with it, we bought it along with the Primo baby tub and it's an ideal match together.The soft pillow protects our son's head and little body from the sink/tub.  There is a little sunken-in area for his little bottom and he LOVES to sit in it and splash around while we bathe him.  After the bath, we simply give it a squeeze and hang it in the shower to drip-dry overnight.  It can be machine washed but will pill-up if it goes through the dryer.  (still works beautifully, though.)This is a FANTASTIC product to bring while traveling - it's allowed us to give him his bath while on vacation or at grandma's house.I HIGHLY recommend this product!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","This is by far the most comfortable item ever invented for baby.Baby doesn't slip, baby is comfortable, baby enjoys bathing and more importantly, mom feels at ease knowing that her baby is safe while she bends to pick up the towel or reaches over for the baby soap.  The baby doesn't move or wiggle around and kudos to whoever invented this product.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","My son is 3 months old and we have been using this bath pad since his first bath when we could only sponge bathe him.  We set the pillow on the counter next to the kithen sink, and then put him on it and gave him his sponge bath.  Once we could submerge him, we just put the pillow into the kitchen sink and added water and put him in.  It works great!  He gets to lie in the bath but he is very comfortable and secure.  Once you finish you just have to find a good place to hang the pillow to drip dry.  We have been using this pillow for all of our 3 month old baby's baths.  Great item and especially a must have if you have a nice big kitchen sink!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Why put your newborn in a hard plastic seat, when you can have him/her lie on a virtual pillow? My kitchen sink is one of those not evenly split; it has a tiny section on one side and extra wide on the other and this bather fits perfectly into it. My baby has never cried (not even the first time)in this. Why should he? He's covered in warm water, has his head propped up just right, and is on a soft pillow. The really great thing about this bather is that it becomes heavy when wet, so it won't slide around. But when you squeeze some of the water out, it instantly becomes light again.  Simply brilliant! Don't even consider any of the others - this one is perfect!!!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","i reccomend this to anyone looking for a safe baby bath. awesome for first time parents. its soft and cushy and baby doesn't slide around. my daughter is 10 months old and still uses it. she has used it since day oen. i wouldn't go with any other tub. safest tub you can buy.it does hold a lot of water, but as long as you hang it to dry, it is fine. drys overnight when its hung up. the best part.. you can toss it in the washer when it gets dirty.A MUST HAVE for new mothers and fathers!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","This is such a cool idea.  No more awkward plastic baby bath tubs.  This is pillow like, but firm.  After bath time it has a hook to hang it to drip dry in the tub.  It seems that it would be easier to bathe baby in this and more comfortable too.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",Very nice and soft for my grand daughter. I love that it hangs and dries very easy. I recommend this to any new mom.,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",Nice and plush and keeps the baby warm while bathing. A bit bit at times but drys quick easy to hang.,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","I am in love with this pillow!  With my third baby I was looking for a better solution to the bath time situation.  In the past I used one of those hard plastic tubs, but was tired of storing it in our tiny bathroom.  A friend suggested this and it is perfect for us.I saw some other reviews said it floats on the water - that is not how this works. It is essentially a pillow - filled with stuffing.  You just put it in the tub and then fill with as much water as you wish.  It is a little puffier in the back to keep the babies head out of the water.  I personally like to put a lot of water in the tub, so I just folded up a little hand towel and shoved it under the head to give her a little more of an angle.  We hang it to dry over the tub and have never had a problem with mildew.  I have thrown it into the washer a few times just to be on the safe side.It worked beautifully with an infant laying down AND for an older baby once they start sitting up but aren't balancing well.  We've used it for a year now and I have no complaints!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Jessi is 4 months old and we have struggled bathing her since she was born, she would slip all over the place and her arms would fly all over the place and she would scream out of insecurity and fear. So I got this as a gift and tried it last night.  I put her in it, fully dressed and dry, so she could be comfortable in it.  And she was fine.  Then later, I put the pillow in her little tub filled it with water, and sat her down in it, and she loved it!  Not a peep out of her, she let us wash her and wash her hair.  She smiled...it was wonderful, we even video taped it (she'll love that later on).  When it was over, we wrung it out real good and hung it on the shower bar to dry.  It was great! I highly recommend this to any parent that needs to make the bath easier and more pleasant.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","I bought this bather because the other bathers that I saw did not look comfortable or safe.  We've used this bather since my son was born - he's now 5 months.  We love it and so does he.  It is not slippery at all and offers him a very comfortable, reclining place while being bathed.  I also love the fact that you can run it under the water while preparing the bath and it holds the warmth from the water.  There is no hard, cold plastic.  The only downside is after a few months, it must be replaced due to the fact that it's not plastic and absorbs water every time you bath your baby.  But for the price, you can't beat it!",4,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",The SaferBather is soft and easy to clean. It dries easily and can be stored when not in use. I love it...the baby loves it...and that is what sells this product!,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We used this product for my son's sponge baths when he was first brought home.  He loved these baths so much that we actually put off tub baths for quite a while.  It turns out he loves tub baths too!  We actually used this on our changing table (with waterproof lap pads over it, so as not to get it too dirty) for his early changings because while he loved sponge baths, he hated having his diaper changed.  This tactic definitely helped.  It's also very portable if you have to give baths over at Grandma's - it can be used in a sink!  Most people haven't heard of this product, so it makes a great and unique shower gift.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Love this!!!!!!!  I have a regular baby bath tub and I used it with my son for the first month or so and it was a real chore to bathe him.  You're so busy trying to keep them from sliding to one side or getting water in their ears.  You have to keep one hand on the baby at all times so trying to wash with only one hand is very difficult.  Then I saw this bather on Amazon.com and I read the reviews.  I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did.  My son is 3 months old now and we use this bather for every bath.  Mostly, I just set it inside of the baby bath tub.  He fits right down inside and there is no more sliding around.  I am free to use two hands to wash him and he stays warm during the bath so no more screaming.  Other times I lay it in our bath tub and he just lays there staring up at me.  I have already told all my pregnant friends about this safer bather.  I just love it because it helps make his bath time a good bonding time...not something we're both dreading.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! I've never had a problem bathing her. She loves taking a bath in this. Dont even waste your money on those hard plastic ones. This is the bath tub!!,5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","What a wonderful product!!  I have back trouble, so carrying those baby bath tubs in and out of our large tub was a real problem.  I found this and LOVE IT!!  For the first 3 months of my little girl's life, we bathed her using this in the kitchen sink.  When she outgrew the sink, we used it in our regular bathtub.  What a great product...it absorbs the warm water and cradles her with just enough support that she can really enjoy her bath...she's over a year old, and it still comes in handy when washing her hair.  I couldn't have lived without it and now buy it for all of my ""expectant"" friends!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","After attempting to bathe baby in sink and the bigger,hard, baby tubs, my newborn sounded like she was being tormented!  I tried this and it was wonderful!  She can lie with her head propped up and no trying to hold a wet baby.  I fill my tub with warm water just so it covers the mat and lay her on it.  She now loves her bathtime!",4,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!",4,1
BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon - Blue,"I was looking around for the best feeding dish when this bowl/spoon caught my eye.  I read the reviews and purchased it.  It was the best bowl/spoon I have ever sat in front of a kiddo!  Too bad I didn't discover it until my fourth child!  Like other good reviews, the shape is excellent for cornering food, the sides are not too high to be a challenge getting the food up and out of the bowl.  The chunky spoon is perfect and the rubber rim is perfect at giving the grip needed to offset the pressure the scooping of food makes to the edge of the bowl.  My little guy was an independent eater at 1 1/2 half, I should add the he has Down Syndrome and found eating with this bowl a breeze!  I would suggest that the first time you give it to your child you stand behind the highchair and guide the childs hand to the bowl, scoop and bring to his mouth.  I did this demonstration twice and he took right off!!  He does throw the bowl when the food is gone, and it has never broken in almost a year of use.",5,1
BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon - Blue,Baby can easily hold and feed herself with these spoons -- they are great. A little pricey but I think worth it.,5,1
Blue Jean Teddy Mobile,My sons love this! It was one of the first toys they smiled at! Especially the panda which they follow around and smile when it comes back to them. The music plays for quite a while too. I also like the button on top that allows you to stop the music if you want.,5,1
My Little Snoopy Lambs &amp; Ivy Products for Baby Musical Mobile plays Brahms' Lullaby,My son absolutely loves this mobile.  It never fails to get him to smile.  I highly recommend it!,5,1
Deluxe Music In Motion Developmental Mobile W Remote,"I really like this mobile. It is much better than the ones you can get that match your nursery set. My baby loves to watch this mobile turn and the hesitation helps him to focus and study the images. It is nice to have a choice of 2 different songs sets or white noise. I have had some trouble with the remote working, but I don't use it that much so it's not that big of a problem. Also it's nice to be able to change the toys on the mobile as your child gets older. It helps them from getting tired of it. Great product!!",4,1
Deluxe Music In Motion Developmental Mobile W Remote,"Our son (2.5 months old) still sleeps in a bassinet, but he enjoys being laid down in his crib for up to 15 minutes or so to gaze at this mobile. We're pretty happy with this purchase, I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, because I imagine I could like something better and I haven't compared it to any other mobiles. It's also nice as other people have said because many of the pieces can continue to be used as toys in the future! The stuffed toys do fasten well, you have to make sure to tug the knot into the plastic arm in the right way.",4,1
Deluxe Music In Motion Developmental Mobile W Remote,"This is such a great mobile for the price!  Even after he could sit up, I just took the arm off and used the music box in his crib.  To this day, he is 3 now!, he still uses the music box in his big boy room.  We have it attached to the side of his bed and he falls asleep to the music every night.I am now pregnant again and will have to buy another one for my daughter!A definite must-have!",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,"We have a doorway between the front room and kitchen that must be a non-standard width, because the gate alone is a smidge too small, but when we added the extension, the whole unit wouldn't fit in the doorway.  It would be better design if there was an overlap of about 1/2"" between the two sizes.",4,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,"This fit perfectly and did exactly what it was supposed to do. I am very happy with this purchase, thanks.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,We LOVE this gate extender!!!  I only made it 4 stars simply for the fact that we can't use it at the top of the stairs - we put it at the bottom to keep our twin daughters from going up and we can quickly adjust it to fit their bedroom door when we need to.  This is an awesome gate - our 4 year old son had trouble getting it open at first but he 'hops' on the pedal to open it (which is great - I don't have to help him).  This extender is so easy to install to the gate and to take on and off.  It's a great gate - I can open it with my hands full of laundry or other stuff and close it too.,4,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,I have the older style hands free First Years gate and was a little concerned if this would fit but it fits perfectly and my gosh it really makes a difference. The gate fit our hallway before the extension but the supports were almost all the way extended so when we saw that the extension was only 15.00 we decided to give it a go.I do not know how we lived without it. It used to be kinda wobbly and I found myself tightening it every few days. I have not had to tighten it since we bought this extension. I is sooooooooooooooooo much sturdier.,5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","After living in SE Asia for the last 7 months, I noticed that the restaurants are not toddler/child friendly. When my husband and I go out to eat, we never know if the restaurant will have a high chair, much less a booster seat for our 2 year old. This item is not only useful for these situations, but it's so light and compact that it's not a hassle to carry around. Additionally, it is perfect for packing in the suitcase. I am so glad I bought this one. And even better, my daughter loves it.",5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","This is a great product! Although it is perfect for restaurants and use as a booster when travelling, I attached it to the seat in my utility cart so I can baby sit my grandson while working in the yard. Really cool the way it ""self-inflates"".",5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","Love this seat! Used it for both our kids and am getting another one for child number three. The first one is still usable, just dirtier than I would like it to be because it was so well-loved. We liked it so much we ended up using it on a regular basis instead of on the go. Safe, won't slide, straps click into each other solidly...we've never had an issue!",5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","We have been using the First Years on-the-go booster seat for almost a year and it gets daily use.  We decided to purchase this seat b/c we have a pub height dining table that was too high for most hi-chairs.  This booster seat has been awesome.  The bottom inflates and deflates depending on how high you want your child to sit.  It packs up nice and compact for traveling, although we have never used this traveling since it is our main hi-chair.  Our son likes to lean to the side as far as he can so he cracked one of the buckles, but it still locks and holds him in place :-)",5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari",We have been using this booster everyday since my son was ten months old and have really enjoyed the versatility. We bought it while we were traveling (which we do frequently) and it worked great on the chairs in the hotel and at our home. I have a friend that we stay with a lot and it doesn't work well on her kitchen chairs. I think the back support on the chair is too high (similar to a folding chair) and the seat slides back. It is really easy to clean and the straps are easy to adjustmy son feels safe and secure in it (He is a big kid. I can see how little ones may not feel as secure.Can't use it on a folding chair or chairs that taper significantly smaller to the back of the chair. The bottom strap will always be loose. So far we have only had a problem with this once.,5,1
Mud Pie Little Princess Ceramic Piggy Bank,This is the cutest little piggy I have ever seen.  The little shoes were unexpected.  My 4 year old grandchild just loves this piggy.,5,1
Mud Pie Little Princess Ceramic Piggy Bank,My granddaughter loved it! She loves ballerinas and wanted a big piggy bank for her birthday. I never expected to find both in the same piggy bank.,5,1
Mud Pie Little Princess Ceramic Piggy Bank,only problem was getting piggy into its pink container after having taken it out to examine it...cute litle item for my  newborn great neice...colors great...N.B....reviews should not require 20 words when 3-4 would do...tb,4,1
Especially for Baby Wipe Warmer with bonus Diaper Organizer,It warms your wipes great just when you get to the bottom they are dried out.  We use ours everyday and they still dry out.  But having warm wipes to clean her and wash her off when we are in a hurry definately outweighs the dried out wipes at the bottom.,4,1
Safety 1st: Rockin' Jitter Buggy,"My son really enjoys his jitter buggy, it has cute indicator lights and sounds, he loves the vibration, he's 6 months and has sat happily in it up to an hour while I was cleaning. Once he gets bored with one side, I turn the seat so he's facing the other direction. I got it on sale at a great price so definitely worth the price.It is a bit bulky, luckily our apartment has an open layout so it tucks away against a wall, but it is not portable and you can't really store it. I do move it room to room without any problem, even when he is in it, I just push it into the kitchen or family room and nothing falls apart (as another reviewer wrote)",4,1
Safety 1st: Rockin' Jitter Buggy,"My son was 5 1/2 months when I had first put him the Jitter Buggy.  He was so intrigued by the many different sounds it made.  He really like pushing the radio and horn.  I put him in the Buggy while he watches his Baby Einstein video.  He loves it.  He recently starting spin around to pay with the back of the car.  I definitely think everyone should invest in one.  It's cute, durable and most importantly entertaining!",5,1
Especially for Baby Bottle Warmer,"My husband and I love this bottle warmer. It has helped us give our daughter a warm bottle everytime. It has an automatic shutoff button that lights up when its on, turns off when the milk is ready. There is a small plastic two valve compartment on the left that holds water to put in the warmer. Definitely add this to any new parent wish list.",5,1
Especially for Baby Bottle Warmer,"Very convenient product - especially during the nights since you don't want to go through the hassle of warming up the contents under hot tap water. Also, the auto shut off feature is best I liked since I tend to forget things when I am half asleep. :-)Good buy - whether it is a gift or a buy - worth it!",5,1
Especially for Baby Bottle Warmer,"This warmer seems to do the trick.  It does take a long time but it consistantly keeps the right temp if you follow the directions carefully.  I have not had the problems the other reviews state.  My basket has not burned.  I love the removable ring to accomadate different size bottles.  I like that you can keep it plugged in and that it has a removable carrying case that has a freezer pak in it.  Overall, a great product.",4,1
Safety 1st Comfy Bath Center in Light Blue,"This bath was the best thing that I registered for. It was so easy to use, and so comfortable for my daughter. She loved taking baths! I would fill it up and carry it out to bathe her in the living room since it was easier than the tub (when she was still laying down). She sat in this tub until about 9 months, and she was a big girl! I love how it has a water cup that comes with it, which we are still using 19 mos later, and the cup holders perfectly fit shampoo and bodywash bottles. The temperature gauge is right on, especially when you are  a new mom. My cousin just registered for the newer version of this bath in off white and green, and I HAD to get it for her, knowing how awesome it is!",5,1
Safety 1st Comfy Bath Center in Light Blue,"We've really liked this tub. The base fits in a single sink, and the way the seat is angled keeps small babies pretty secure. I thought it was fantastic for a young baby. I will say, as my baby approaches six months, I don't like how it fits anymore - her feet stay out of the water, making them chilly, and only her tush is underwater so there isn't really anywhere to splash or play. So my caveat is while it's great for a young baby, don't expect this to be one of those ""infant to toddler"" tubs you see around. Baby will need a bigger tub or need to move to the grownup tub after a few months. Also, the plug is hard to get in and out - I ended up leaving it in and dumping the whole tub every time - not a big deal, but something to note.",4,1
The First Years Take &amp; Toss Spill-Proof Cups - 7 oz - 6 Pk,"We are on our third batch of these sippy cups for our twin daughters. They are simply to use, come in wonderful, vibrant colors, and are surprisingly hard to generate messes with (a bonus with two children).The cups themselves are sturdy and durable. They survive whatever abuse is dealt to them. We have not yet had any problems with cracking or breakage of the lid, the part that understandably takes the most stress. We use them every day, and replace them fairly frequently (when the start to look dingy and 'old'), and have thus far been quite happy with these cups.However! I wish that they were not so hard to get clean. We hand wash all plastics that our daughters use, so if you use the dishwasher for cleaning these your experience is likely to differ. The problem I have is that food/dry liquid gets stuck in a small groove on the inside of the spout. It is very hard, even with considerable soaking, to get the crusty bits out of that space. We toss the cups as soon as this becomes noticeable, but a slight design change to eliminate the space would be welcome to those of us who are hand washing.These cups certainly fulfill their mission and I am very happy we have them, I just wish we could get a little more mileage out of them before tossing (since every little bit helps - replacing frequently is somewhat expensive!).",4,1
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We all love this seat. I have a 17 month old in the 97 percentile for weight and height and she fits in this fine. I have to say that we don't use the tray at all because we just scoot her up to the table and she fits in just fine. I never had a problem cleaning it and we use it wherever we go - visiting friends, travelling, at the restaurants that don't have high chairs (yes, there are a few out there)....And it's inexpensive too!",5,1
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We bought this booster because the restraint system on high chair wasn't designed to hold a child into the seat and our 14 month old daughter learned that she could stand up in the seat while buckled in.  After 2 days, we think this booster is great!  She loves to eat at table height, the restraint is excellent, and after making sure to really tighten the straps that fasten it to the chair, the fit is very snug.  I checked the straps and re-tightened today, fyi, might want to check with frequency that they stay tightened.  We are planning on traveling next week and plan to take it with us.  We haven't used the tray, it's small, but then again, it's supposed to be a portable seat.  In response to the comment regarding the classic wooden high chair... we have a small place so we thought we wanted something that would be inconspicuous and fit in with the furniture.  The wooden high chairs are high maintenance as far as cleaning!  There is no ""hosing it down"" in the shower, like I've heard other moms do with their plastic chairs, and the seat pad is cloth, so it too is a chore to keep clean.  We took ours off and found that the wood veneer started to peel on the seat from wiping with a damp sponge after each meal... I would now choose plastic and low maintenance over aesthetics any day!",4,1
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We started using this booster seat when our daughter turned one.  Mostly we use it for family functions outside our home where there are no highchairs.  It allows me to be able to eat with the rest of my family without having to hold Brooke on my lap or feed her first.  She sits securely in her seat right at the table with us and can feed herself.I love how compact it is - especially when there is so much stuff to lug when travelling with a baby.  In fact, I just keep it in the back of my SUV.  It is easy to clean - I have put the whole thing right in my dishwasher.The only thing I feel that could be improved are the retractable straps.  It is difficult to tighten the straps which secure the booster onto a kitchen chair - a bit stressful when you have a hungry toddler anxious to eat.But, for the money I feel this seat overall is a good buy.  Would definitely recommend to others.",4,1
3 Easy Grasp Soft Bite Spoons (Color Changes),Love these spoons. Baby can handle the middle size and biggest size as soon as they start to grasp. Other spoons with long thin metal handles would be much more difficult for a baby to handle themselves.,5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame, White","I am very satisfied with the quality of the frame. The clay, I'll admit, was not super easy to use, but after about 30 minutes of trying we finally got a very cute handprint of our then-six-month-old. I'm so glad we did - she's almost nine months now, and her hand is already bigger. They grow so fast! I'd highly recommend this as a gift to yourself (as I did) or as a baby shower gift.",5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame, White","The frame itself is just okay, but the easy to put together footprint and photo for grandparents made it worthwhile.",5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame, White",I loved this keepsake frame kit.  The first one I received as a present was not usable b/c the clay that came with it was already hard and not pliable.  I had to exchange it for another kit.  There should be some sort of date on the box to check for product freshness.,4,1
Fisher-Price Sounds'n Lights Monitor,"This monitor is great--especially for how cheap it is. I tried a more expensive Graco model and it had so much buzzing that I couldn't even hear the baby's noises! But the Sound' n Lights monitor has minimal buzzing (unless, of course, I try to put the receiver right next to an electric appliance) and is very clear. Plus, the on/off dial on the monitor is very quiet so it doesn't wake the baby when I turn it on.",4,1
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count","These are good and safe, exactly what they should be but, if i had known better i would have bought the sliding ones with the screw.",4,1
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count","I purchased these after reading the reviews on how hard they are to remove so I was not too surprised by how hard they are to remove - lol. You just need to figure out how to take them out and find a gadget that can help depress the safety - a screw driver works well for us. We bought two types, put these in the areas our son has a lot of access, and on outlets we dont use much. We used a cheaper, easier to remove style on the other outlets.",4,1
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count",These are the ONLY covers that actually stay in!!! All other types our son would pull out and chew on. These are a life saver!,5,1
Two Avent Magic Cup Trainer Handles (colors may vary),"One of the things that sold me on the avent bottle system was that it would 'grow with my baby.' Then why the heck do I have to buy a whole separate cup to get these handles? I have a small kitchen and I don't have the space to buy more cups I don't need, so thank you to this vendor for selling these handles separately. Yes I have a boy, and yes I received pink handles. Do I think that it will scar him for life or in some way damage him? No, that's crazy. But I am very pleased that I now have handles that work with my existing cups and I didn't have to unnecessarily waste anything by throwing away extra cups I wouldn't have had space for.",5,1
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"This is truly the Cadillac of strollers, rear wheels turn so the stroller handles great. Peg Perego is a great company one phone call to this company and you can tell they stand behind their product. I had some questions about safety recalls and they were more than helpfull. Highly recommend this product, you pay a little more but you get what you pay for.",5,1
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"2003 Review: I spent four weeks researching strollers before I finally bought this one for my six-month old. My research involved going to all of the product websites, reading customer reviews, stopping people with various strollers on the street, talking with friends, and trying them each out in the stores. I had been borrowing an infant car-seat/snap-and-go combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughter's life and knew what I liked and didn't like about that stroller. In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking, a good-quality, durable stroller is critical --so you do need to spend a bit more money.After seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system, the Graco Metrolite, the Combi TravelSavvy, the Maclaren Volo & Techno, the Bertini M5, the Peg Perego Pliko and this one, I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot. The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller, but only marginally so, and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight: the MacLaren's seats don't fully recline; and that is important when you are on long strolls/shopping trips that run into nap-time. Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego. So after much backing and forthing, I took the chance on the Peg Perego. I'm really glad I did.I had a feeling I'd made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box.  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions: unlike so many items I've bought for my baby, it's operation was perfectly intuitive. It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks (pot holes, ice lumps, gravely streets, ramp-less curbs) and handles so well I can steer it with one hand --as easily as the MacLaren. It's not quite as small when folded, but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs. It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined (storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident) and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have. Note also that storage space was a deal-breaker with the Peg Perego Pliko, too: it is completely inaccessible from above --you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side. The Venezia's adjustable handle is nice and high so that you don't have to stoop to walk with it (I'm 5'7""). It's as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno. I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy baby-carriage in the winter. Another cold-weather plus: the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm. The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and I've gotten many a compliment on it already. Sure, it would be nice to have a parent cup-holder, but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other --and it's probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the baby's head. This is a great stroller, even for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to the City-dweller.2005 Edit to this review: This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old. After that, it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight. I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since. I would still use this stroller if I had another baby, but only for the first year and a half. I still recommend the Venezia, but I recommend buying the Volo when baby gets too heavy and/or when it doesn't need/can't fit in the wonderful bunting the Venezia offers.",5,1
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"My daughter is now one years old and has had far more strollers in her first year of life than I'd care to count! I simply love strollers!So when I had the chance to by the Venezia I jumped at it!Here is what I like about it:The fabrics are some of the best in the stroller market, they're plush and well made. They're easily washed and cared for and contiune looking new for a long time! The padding on this stroller is amazing - there aren't enough words to describe it! The boot is great for keeping little ones warm and cozy - especially on those cold and rainy days (we don't get much snow here in Seattle!) When the seat is upright the hood can be brought down to the boot to make a safe enclosure from the weather! The reversalble handle is nice, as is the height adjustment on it! The new black nubby wheels handle beautifully - I know many mention having problems on uneven sidewalks, I never experienced this with the new wheels. It's easy to push, even with one hand. The new snack bar is also nice - with a cup holder and large tray area!What I didn't like so much:Despite the adjustable height handle - it's still a little too short for me (at 5'11&quot;) I did kick the back a few times. The fold is easy enough, but the hooks to keep it locked in place came off a few times, they just slide over the peg. It wasn't a big deal, but I had it open on my toe a time or two when I wasn't expecting it!Overall I think this is a great stroller once you get used to it! As with any new product reading the instructions are key - I can't even begin to count how many times I've seen a mom walking through the mall with the whole thing going sideways because she didn't lock the back wheels!This is the perfect stroller if you're looking for something plush and comfy for your little one - mine loves it! It's great for the mall and shopping, it handles amazingly well for a stroller of it's size, even with one hand. The weight isn't too bad (though I have a few 25lbs + strollers so it's all relative!)",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This diaper pail is great.  The refills are continuous rolls that you tie off and remove with an attached safety cutter, and they seem to last forever.  They come three to a pack and I think we've only bought two refill packs in 15 months.  The pail is really easy to use - just step on the pedal and drop the diaper in.  Given how stinky our toddler's diapers have been lately, it's amazing how well it contains the odors.  You might smell a little something if it the bag is full, but that's about it.  When she was on breastmilk or formula, we never smelled a thing.  I'm giving the pail 4 stars instead of 5 because it looks like she might be able to get the pail open (with difficulty).  So far, we've been able to distract her before she got it open.  But we may have to move it to the closet soon.",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I have been using my diaper pail by Dekor for 8 months now and I love it. I have tried out a few of the others via my girlfriends, and none seem to be as easy to use and works as well.The foot pedal design to open the lid sold me. (you're hands are busy enough!) Although it can be heavier to lift due to the sealing around the edge of the lid, it gets the job done better then anything having to use my hands, and I never have a problem getting my dirty diaper in the pail due to this. The seal is worth it!The diapers drop through another door that automatically opens when you drop the diaper on it, and closes back up after by it's self.The liner bags are well designed in that you tie off the bag at the bottom, and simply fill with diapers as you would a regular trash bag (no crazy long diaper sausage!) The bottom opens up when you're ready to change the bag. It has a small ""razor edge"" (very well protected from any injury) on the inside of the door that you slice the bag off however full it is. Tie it off again at the bottom, and you're all set! (Sounds harder and more complicated then it really is.)I did hesitated at the thought of having to buy replacement bags. I bought two boxes before my daughter was born, and she is now 8 months old, and I STILL have not had to buy any more boxes yet! Not as costly as I had thought....especailly for the convienence of it all!!Smell. Well, it really does do a good job with smells. As we all know, as baby's diet changes, so does the smell of her diapers!  I'd say, I didn't smell a THING until 6-7 months old with the introduction of solids. Of course, I wouldn't want to think about how it'd be now without the Dekor! I did my research before buying a diaper pail, and in a comparision test of the top selling diaper pails, this one was the winner....especailly smell factor! Regular cleaning and Lysoling helps keep the pail as fresh as possible.I reccomend this pail to all my friends. Personal experience, reviews and word of mouth are the best way to gather your research in the quest for your perfect baby products!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,No foul odors.  Easy to use.  Refill bags last about 3 months.Would definetly recommend for anyone who is expecting.=),5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This is GREAT!!! My husband and I LOVE THIS! It's so incredibly east to dispose of the dirty, stinky diapers and the stink is completely trapped. The bag is equally easy to change when ready to dispose of the diapers. It's amazing how that when the smelly diaper goes in, the smell is instantly gone. FABULOUS!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We have had the Diaper Dekor for 22 months now and are very happy with it.  The step on, one hand functionality is terrific.  It keeps the odors in and is easy to use and keep clean.  The front door is pretty easy to open.  We simply try not to draw attention when we change the bags to diminish her curiosity.  We have not any problems with her trying to get into it.  When our daughter reached 18 months or so, we decided not to put dirty diapers in the Diaper Dekor. Instead we put them in a plastic grocery bag and simply take them directly to the trash outside (there are far fewer now than when she was smaller).  We found we were able to use plain white kitchen garbage bags in the Diaper Dekor and they worked fine.  We are expecting our second child and will be purchasing another Diaper Dekor.  I would suggest using the recommended liners unless you decide not to put the dirty diapers in after your child gets older.",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I can't say enough about the Diaper Dekor Plus system.  It truly holds as many diapers ODOR free as they say it does.  Our son is 3 months old and we've only just opened a second bag a couple of weeks ago!  (Each box of refills contains 3 bags, but they include one bag when you purchase the Diaper Dekor Plus.)  At the rate we are going, we won't need to open another box of refills until close to his 6 month birthday.Don't let the price tag worry you - it's WELL worth the price because there is absolutely no odor.  With two dogs in the house, we worried that the diaper can would become a hunting ground, but they haven't shown the least bit of interest.  The bag is a cinch to dispose of, and I LOVE how you can cut it off at any point you want.  In the long run, the refills are much cheaper than the other brands and it's well worth the money to not have to waste your time on flimsy grocery-store bags - they simply can't contain the stink - find another use for them - line your other waste pails with them.  Diapers need special attention, and the Diaper Dekor Plus fits the bill!I HIGHLY recommend this stylish, practical and cost-effective disposal system!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We have 7 month twins so we need things to be simple and fast. This diaper pail is both. I especially like that when you need to empty it, you barely have to touch anything. When you empty it, it takes less than a minute to pull out the dirty ones and get it set it up again. Smells don't escape, even when it's being emptied. When our girls are out of diapers, we are going to keep it for kitty litter. Such a good buy!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"The Diaper Dekor works so well I keep it in my daughter's closet with her clothes.  Try that with a Diaper Genie!  I am amazed by the number of diapers it holds without sacrificing quality or functionality.  The one-hand operation is a life-saver.  Simply put, the Diaper Dekor is a must-have item for your nursery, whether you are using cloth or disposable diapers!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This pail is pretty great. My only complaint is I wish the diaper door was a little larger. It's hard to get a cloth diaper through quickly without getting the mess on the can itself. The door lock is a great feature for nosy babies though. My husband couldn't figure out how to open it at first because he was simply not paying attention, so I hope it'll stump our toddler when he gets too curious. :)",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We have enjoyed the use of this product for our son. The foot pedal is the main reason we chose this product. With a squirming child, being able to use one hand for diaper disposal is a plus! We have had no issues with odor. I also love the economical practicality of the refills. The fact that you can choose how much of the bag to tie up makes it user friendly and saves money. In the nursery, it looks like just a waste basket instead of a ""poop disposal unit"" as my husband calls it. I can't say enough about how easy it is to change the refills and empty the bags. The double doors are easy to push the diaper through and keeps your hands and the unit clean. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try, you won't regret it!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"LOVE IT!!!  We purchased the Dekor Plus on 2/23/11; the liners that came with it lasted until 5/6/11. Our baby turns 1 in a couple weeks and is wearing a size 4 diaper; we only took the bag out when we couldn't stuff anymore diapers into it. I have a very sensitive nose and even with the can sitting right next to the couch, I smell nothing! Prior to this, we used an open pail, so wish we would have purchased this sooner.  Oh and we do not use the biodegradable refills based on previous reviews, we use the scented white ones. Also love the foot pedal or the option of being able to dispose the diaper by opening the lid with my hand, I use both methods. This can allows you to use a regular trash bag if desired which we could do in a pinch. I loved this can from day one but wanted to wait to write my review to make sure it help up to my expectations.  Buy it!",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I've used this diaper pail since my daughter was born and the first 11 months I was extremely happy with. I usually only have to change the bag about once per week, so it can hold a lot of diapers. And I hardly ever noticed a smell, except when changing the bag obviously. It takes slightly longer to replace the bag using the refills than a normal trash bag, but it's still very easy overall. However, after about 10-11 months of using this it started to stink. Badly. Like I could smell poo when I walked into the nursery. My husband even took the entire pail to the car wash and gave it a thorough cleaning. That somehow didn't even help. So I just bought a replacement. I have no idea why cleaning it from top to bottom wouldn't address the problem, but it didn't. But even with that I liked it enough to buy another one.",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I like the product but gave only 4 stars because of the price of the product and also the expensive refills which donot come a long time.PROS----1) eliminates odors to much extent because of the triple seal2) step on so u dont have to put ur hands and wash again3) easy to use4) sleek design5) can be used as a stylish trash can later6) very easy disposal mechanism. just open the door and cut the bag and tie the new bag.7) easy to put the replacement liners also8) not difficult to use like diaper genie and otherCONS----1) once the bag is full, u will see stars to take out the bag.2) liners r very expensive3) doesnt take the plastic grocery bags4) even this big size one gets filled very easily and u have to push down with ur hand to put other diapers. otherwise u will run out of liners in 2 days5) with 4 or 5 diapers itself it becomes full and if u dont push them down u can not use the step on trashing/ and this way u will HAVE to use ur hand.",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I would whole heartedly recommend this product.  I tried the diaper Genie and could never figure out how to change out the bag, or hardly how to use the thing.  With the Diaper Dekor, I pulled it out of the box and it was ready to go.  When it was time to change the liner (which does last a LONG time, I was shocked) it was very straight forward.  It didn't even require reading the directions (who has time for that when you have a baby after reading all of the parenting books and other safety manuals).  It is a bit more expensive, but definitely worth the extra $10 for the hands free and bag changing ease.  Plus, if the diapers sit in it for less than a week it really doesn't start smelling very much, but go over a week and you will start to smell it.",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I recommend the Diaper Dekor to all my friends; it works so well. It is very easy to use, and one refill package will last up to 6 months--definitely worth the money.  A regular trash bag will even fit (but in the long run, the refill is actually less expensive).  Our daughter is 2 yrs old and potty training, but we still have some yucky diapers, the Diaper Dekor controls odor very well, even for the older babies with stinkier poo:)  Diaper Genie and others just cannot compete.",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,I was looking for a hands-free pail and came across this on the internet.  The reviews were all 5 stars so I purchased it.  After 2 months of use I have only 2 complaints.  There is more odor that lingers after use than I expected.  I suppose I could change the bag more often but the liners are expensive and I have been unable to find refills anywhere but online.  It would be better if the refills were more readily available.,4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"After checking out all the different kinds of diaper pails we decided to go with this one. We love it!You only need one hand to throw the soiled diaper away. As for changing the liner, it is very easy. When I saw that the refills cost about $20.00 for 3 bags I thought oh my gosh. But they last such a long time that it is very worth it! My daughter is 1 year old now and we've only had to buy maybe 4 refills so far. I'd say that is very good!The diaper dekor does not allow any odor to stink up my daughter's room. Unless you leave dirty ones in there for a few days. We take them out probably 3 times a week, and that works great. I would recommend this pail to anyone.",5,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"this system works better than others, my only complaints are that the trap doors are not stronger, they don't always close and one of them recently broke-it hangs down now, I have not contacted the company about a replacement so I can't say anything about customer service and frankly I think it would probably be easier to just buy a new one, which I plan to do.",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"After much research, I had it narrowed down between this and the Diaper Genie.  I got this one and I LOVE it!  My son is now 8 1/2 mo. and we keep this in our family room.  My husband thinks every baby product is a crock, but he even commented about how great this diaper system is.  This is on my short list of baby items I couldn't live without!",5,1
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,I just bought this toy for my 3 month old son and it's the greatest! He is just now starting to reach for and grasp things and loves grabbing the crinkle ears and ring on top of the puppy. This is the first toy he's really interacted with and doesn't seem to get bored with it at all. The puppy is a good size and the barking noise is baby-friendly...not scary to him in any way. It's great watching him start to play with things and this toy has started it off on a great note!,5,1
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"My son has had this toy for 3 months now and he LOVES it. The ears crinkle, he chews on the ring, it's easy for him to grab. I love the bright colors and the dog sounds it makes. Well worth the money.",5,1
Diaper Dekor 3 Pack Refill,"I used the diaper genie with my first two children, and the Diaper Dekor with my last two-hands down I would choose the diaper dekor, and the refills.  The refills hold more diapers, are much stronger and easier to use and install, and have a lot less smell to me than the genie. Also, its very simple for both my 2 and 4 yr. olds to use.  Thanks for a great option to holding all those nasty diapers.  A helpful hint, for real bad diapers, put them into a plastic sandwich bag and it holds the smell much better!",4,1
Diaper Dekor 3 Pack Refill,"WE COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THIS DIAPER SYSTEM, THE REFILLS ARE A BIT PRICEY HOWEVER DO LAST A LONG TIME. MY SON IS 3 MONTHS OLD AND WE ARE JUST NOW ON THE SECOND REFILL (AND 3 COME IN ONE BOX). THEY SMELL NICE (LIKE A POWDER SCENT) AND MAKE EMPTYING THE DIAPERS AN EASIER CHORE.",5,1
Diaper Dekor 3 Pack Refill,"A friend recommended the Diaper Dekor to me, one reason being that the refills last a long time.  My son is eight months old and we've only used two boxes.  The refill is just a long bag or tube.  You tie a knot in the bottom.  When the pail is full, cut the top of the bag (the pail has a cutter on the inside of the door), throw the full part away and tie a new knot.  Putting the first refill in can be tricky, but there is a diagram in the box to explain how to do it.  After you've done it once, it's really easy subsequent times.  My only complaint is that you have no way to see when the refill is about empty.  If they had a red line on the bag like cash register receipt paper does, it would be much more convenient.  Not knowing when the bag is about out means that it sometimes falls loose from the top and the dirty diapers end up loose in the pail.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads, 40-Count","These do the job just fine, and I like them especially for times when you will be moving around a lot & your nursing bra might shift (like at nighttime). They are very easy to reposition as needed with little fussing or thought. However, when going out-and-about it is worth noting that they do create quite the bump silhouette under your clothes, so ought to be worn with a very thick bra or clothing is you don't want the hump to show.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads,  100-Count","I have found these to be just the right size.  As long as you have a comfortable, yet snug nursing bra, there isn't a problem with the pad fitting in place.  And because they are so thick, they have kept me from having embarassing leaks as they hold more than thinner pads.  I would highly recommend these to others.",5,1
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads,  100-Count","These pads are wonderful.  I can be confident that they will not leak, and they are very comfortable.  They are visible with certain bras while wearing tighter shirts, but still worth the piece of mind.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads,  100-Count","It's perfect for everyday use. I used a pair everyday. It's quite absorbent. I would recommend this to others. I liked this product, and it was a good deal too.",5,1
"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads,  100-Count",Overall These Avent Nursing pads work well. They absorb a lot and are a good size. They breathe better than others I have tried. The only dislikes I have with them is they are a little scratchy when you first put them in; at night when I am sleeping they shift a bit (Most of the time its not a problem); and they can be seen when wearing light colored t-shirts.For the price I would definitely buy them again.,4,1
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.,5,1
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,"We got this for our 8 1/2 month old son because he is just dying to walk and we thought this would help him.  He loved it right from the beginning, even on our wood floors he got the hang of it in about an hour. It doesn't turn, as other reviewers mentioned and it's funny to watch him ram into something over and over, thinking it will move out of his way!  It can go very fast on wood floors and it doesn't always move forward in a straight line (the floor is very slippery) but he still loves it.  Our son would ""walk"" this thing around all day if we let him!",5,1
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,"I have afriend who has the play zone activity centre and because it was so good I thought I would try the walker/strider, and because it would last my daughter longer due to it converting to a strider.I read up on it in a catolgue and it said &quot;starts by steading first steps&quot; I thought great, wnet the shop brought one and it said the same on the box.How on earth can it steady first steps when there is nothing to help slow the wheels down?I will say though that I had not even got it out of the box and my 8 1/2 mth daughter was all over it.",4,1
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,"My daughter is 10 months old and has been cruising for months now.  We were at a friend's house, and let's just say we ended up leaving with the toy.  We've only had it a few days, but she's wearing tracks in the carpet and putting my back to the test (she's good in a straight line, but has yet to learn turns).  She will even hold on and dance to the music, which, as someone else pointed out is very easy to turn on - you barely touch it and it sings.  Hey, whatever makes her happy!A new must-have in this house.",5,1
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,Grandma bought this toy for my 10 mon old. At first she would put the balls in and was not able to find them. After some help from us she now finds them on the sides. She also enjoys putting things into basket other than the balls. She did get her hand stuck in on of the holes once when we first got it hasn't happended since. We have had the toy for 3 mon now. She is more comfortable pushing it rather than sitting on it. She can press the nose to start music and dances. Keeps her busy for an hour or so which helps alot. She is a very busy baby!,4,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"This monitor is the BEST!  We love it!  What amazes us most is the clear night picture.  Our daughter's room is completely dark at night and we can see her clear as day on this monitor.  The sound is great, too.  We can even hear her breathe.We've got a tri-level home, and keep the screen in the lowest portion most of the time.  The nursery is on the top floor, and the picture is still clear.I had my doubts about this before we bought it, but it has far exceeded our expectations.  We got it home, plugged it in, and we were good to go in about 30 seconds.The only issue we have is that it doesn't take batteries.  I read some reviews that the ""batteries burned out quickly"", but ours doesn't take batteries.  We really wish it did.  It would be nice to have the camera up without having to conceal the cord, and would be nice to be able to really put the screen wherever we want (outside while baby naps, etc).I can't believe there was life before this thing!!!",5,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"WOW! We love our video monitor! This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night! Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room, but my husband and I were a nervous wreck! This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest. We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature! We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around), his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier! We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!Also, when he is napping, it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item. I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months. But for us, 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later...",5,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,I got this as a shower gift and used it when my child was a newborn.  It worked great only I could not sleep with the brightness of the T.V.. I recently started using it again as my son has learned how to take his pants and diaper off at nap time and I can't tell if he's asleep or taking his diaper off.  We also have bible study at our house and set the monitor in the kids room up stairs for the supervising adult to watch.  I think it's definitely worth it and it's nice not to wonder if they are awake or not while you're downsatirs you can simply look at the monitor.  Also I have never had a problem with static or it not working in any room of my house.,4,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"Before our son was born, I had a hard time justifying such a seemingly extravagant monitor.  But in those tough recovery days after birth, it was SO nice to be able to peek in on him without lifting my head off the pillow.  And now that he's in his own room, we can see what's going on, even if he's not crying yet.  The first time we went away for the weekend, we bought those cheap Sound N Lights audio monitors and they were terrible!  You hear so much feedback, and the sound quality is very unclear, so you can't even tell what your baby is doing.  I would highly recommend a video monitor to all parents-to-be, it's worth the extra money for your peace of mind.",5,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"Our master bedroom is on the main floor of our home while our son sleeps upstairs.  During his first two months, he slept beside me in his bassinet.  I would practically sleep with my hand in the bassinet.  Many nights I would sleep sitting up with the baby in my arms.  When we decided to move him upstairs, we purchased the Summer Video Monitor to supplement the audio monitor that we already had.  That was the best decision ever.  Although the picture is not crystal clear, we are able to see if he is awake or we can watch his little stomach rise and fall as he breathes.  Also, the audio component is so sensitive that we can hear the slightest change in his breathing pattern.  We no longer need the other monitor.  I definitely recommend this product to others.",4,1
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"This item was wonderful. We have had this for close to two years. It has been a life saver. My only draw back is it seems the monitor picture has gone out. But we do leave it on all night! I plan on calling the manufactor to see if there is a way to fix it if not, I would buy another one.  The comfort of knowing I can see my son without going into his room was priceless. It also helped comfort us when he was close to giving up his crib and moving to a toddle bed. Twice we caught him almost going over the side of the crib, but was able to stop him before he made it thanks to this monitor. Like I said, maybe we left it on to much and that is what the monitor picture is not working, but the few times this saved us from a potentional injury has made it worth every single penny!!!!!",5,1
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,"Granted, we've only traveled once with this carrier bag, but it fit both our Britax infant carrier car seat AND its base and made our trip much easier. On the return trip we filled the bag with the carrier and its base and heaps of clothes and it came through perfectly. Too bad it doesn't come with a sherpa or strongman to carry it after you load it down!",5,1
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,We have used the travel bag for no less than 10 flights in the past 18 months and it is still going strong.  Not a small feat when you see how luggage is handled. Especially useful to pack coats and extra toys. When we get to the airport we pack the car seat and place coats and toys inside before zipping.  Great for extra space easily available.  Only downside is our son will soon be two and he'll have his own seat on the plane.,5,1
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,"I can honestly give this 5 stars as last month I flew from Ca to Tn. and this held my daughter's infant seat( Graco Snugride), window shades ( side pockets) and 2 full bags of baby gear ( toys, extra bottles) that I had left at Grandma's last time because I had no room for them. I could have easily put in a pack of  diapers and been okay. It made it through the baggage claim without a scratch and I can see me using this for many more trips back home as we live far away from family.None of my things were damaged or dirty and I can feel better knowing my daughter's seat does not  have the germs from the traveling. I had my daughter in her sling and since traveling alone was easily able to get my 60 lb bag of luggage ( gone long time), this seat and carry her. I did not hurt my back and got the seat out while waitng for our ride, put her in her seat and took off the sling which I slipped in this bag all while alone!Andin less than 5 minutes...no kidding! A lady next to me said how amazed she was I did so so easily and quickly.You will not be dissapointed.....",5,1

"Playtex Insulator/Playtime Cup, 9 Ounce, 2 Pack, Colors May Vary","I recently had to switch from the cups with the squishy latex tops because my son was having a good time draining the water out of those and then playing in it. haha. These were a good buy. He adjusted easily to them, and the insulator part is great. I won't have to worry about a bunch of condensation from his cool drinks in the summer making rings all over my tables. I'll be buying more of these. I only wish we could choose the designs on here (or at least specify boy or girl), but luckily, I'm happy with the ones I received.",5,1
"Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary","My mother told me about a bowl, like this, she used to have when we were kids. I found one and ordered it. She was grateful and uses it all the time. I use it as well and it really does keep the food warm.",5,1
"Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary",I wish I had this for my children.  I love using this for my grandbabies.  I don't have to worry about getting the food too hot and the food stays warm for quite a while.  This is great!,5,1
"Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary","i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish.",5,1
"Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary","I had a dish like this for all of my children.  When my granddaughter started on food - I was surprised that none of the local stores carried these dishes.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I like the fact that the dish comes apaprt and can be used seperately, and is easy to clean .  The only drawback is that it's a little difficult to seperate the dish - there should be a tab on the bottom to grab.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My wife said this was a life-saver during her pregnancy, especially during the last few months.The only con is it's hard to turn to another side during the new, as it requires turning this whole pillow with you.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I am tore about these pillows.  I didn't use one at all in my first pregnancy, but am very glad to have it this time.  I am in my third trimester and do have difficulty getting in and out of it sometimes.  But once I am in, it is worth it!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I love this pillow.  It provides exactly the right support and I sleep comfortably through the night.  I wish I knew about this when I was pregnant with my first child.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I had terrible hip / sciatic nerve pain at the beginning of my second trimester. One week of sleeping with this pillow, and all of the pain went away. I love it, and will not be giving it up after pregnancy. It's way too comfortable.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Do not hesitate! If you are pregnant and can't sleep order this pillow now. You won't regret it!  My only criticism is that because I'm so short (5 ft) the pillow is slightly long for me. But even so, it works great!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,If you are pregnant GET THIS PILLOW!!!! Best thing I ever bought myself while pregnant!!! I was so comfy in bed once this snoogle arrived in the mail!!!!! GET IT,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Love this pillow!!! I had been having a hard time sleeping especially on my left side, until I got this pillow. It worked immediately, I was able to take an uniterrupted 3 hour nap using this pillow about 30 min. after I opened it and read the directions/ looked at the demonstration pictures. I also used this pillow to support me as I sit up in bed (reading, eating, watching t.v.) and for extra support while sitting on the sofa. I've even caught my husband using it while sitting up in bed!! The size and shape may seem intimidating at first glance, but it's very easy to use.  The biggest drawback has been that it doesn't stay in it's pillowcases very well and finding a use for now that I am no longer pregnant.  I tried using it for nursing as its manual suggested, but found it too cumbersome.  I got a lot of use of it while I was pregnant though, and would buy it again.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My husband purchased this pillow for me during my first pregnancy.  I immediately fell in love with it.  I was sleeping with 3 pillows and using just this one was much easier. It greatly reduced my back pain and as my belly grew it supported it comfortably.  I am on my 3rd pregnancy in my 3rd trimester, and just now the pillow is starting to wear down.  I use it in the same position and where it goes between my legs it is getting pretty thin.  I will also say the case that it came in isn't the softest, but those two complaints greatly outweigh it's benefits.  I will add that my I have had 2 c-sections and it's great for after that as well.  I think every pregnant mom needs one of these!!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My wife loves it. She's very happy I bought it for her. Obviously you can't put a pillow case over it and it takes up space on the bed, but there's no way around it. Wife is happy. Enough said",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,My wife loves her mother's day gift. She has slept better and had less back problems since sleeping with this pillow.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My wife loves this and I do to when I can steal it from her. I do wish that the portion that is used for the head were softer. My wife says the same thing but other than that, it's perfect. I'm sure I can perform minor surgery and take out some of the filling if it really were to bother me. It's also priced $20 less than at our local mall in Utah.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"About 5 months into my pregnancy I was really having trouble getting comfortable at night.  Regular pillows as barriers, did not work well. I looked into several pillows and purchased this one because it was a total body pillow.  It's been so nice because I can put it behind me and between my legs, which keeps me from rolling on my back (I'm 5'2"", and feel like I have more pillow than I need, which tells me it would work for a taller person).**I recommend purchasing a cover for this pillow**  I thought I would just use the white cover that it comes with, but found out I really needed a pillow case!  Still worth absolutely EVERY PENNY!!**Also, there was a paper included with the pillow that showed 8 different ways to use the pillow including nursing positions, which I found very helpful (because I won't need to purchase another pillow for nursing later).Update:-I did purchase a boppy pillow for nursing.  I found that for a chair or couch, this pillow is just too big and bulky.  It would probably be great if you are staying in bed to nurse, though.-We have a queen sized bed and I had enough room.-Still so glad I had this pillow during pregnancy!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Got this at 4 1/2 months to train myself to sleep on my left side since I'm normally a back sleeper with a tempurpedic neck roll pillow. It's huge, like have a third person in bed but totally trained my body to sleep on my left. Hoping to use it as a Boppy too when feeding time comes.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This was a life saver. My wife said she lived it, it helped her sleep, took pressure off, so on and so on...This thing saved my sanity. If you've ever been the loser teammate (husband) in the whole pregnancy thing, then you know the final 2/3 of the count down is a constant marathon of complaints. This helped my wife sleep, which meant that I wasn't woken up every 10 minutes to be told that she couldn't sleep. This is a life saver and a must have.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I was told by a friend to buy this for my wife when I got her pregnant :)  She has loved it since day 1 and I've since found that every woman we know who has had a child has bought one and loved it.  Great quality - does not need an extra cover, but is recommended if you want to lengthen the life of it.  My wife puts oils and lotions on her belly at night to help avoid stretch marks, so that has slightly yellowed the white cover.  I will probably be strangled now for putting that info in this review, so I hope it's helpful info for someone.  Highly recommended.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Was slightly doubtful about it's use.  So many of my friends swear by its comfort.  So I purchased it.  Was SOOOO worth it!!  As I move along the pregnancy, I can't imagine my life with out it!!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I went back and forth on ordering a pregnancy pillow or not, and i am very glad i did.  Although my pregnancy sleep still isn't great, it is def better with this pillow!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,The was the answer to my wife's pregnancy pain. It's been absolutely great. Do yourself a favor and Buy one,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,Wife loves it and seriously can't sleep without it. She would recommend this product to anyone. 5 stars all the way.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"After having a total hip replacement, I was having a difficult time sleeping on my back. My physical therapist recommended the Snoogle, which allowed me to sleep comfortably on my side without compromising my new hip. The Snoogle was a real lifesaver, I was finally able to sleep through the night!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Purchased this for my sister for Christmas since she recently told us she was expecting. Each time I've seen her, she comments on how great it is and how she would be miserable without it. She can tell a huge difference from before and after. Added bonus - the dog loves it too - he gets a bit upset being pushed away when she ready to use it.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This pillow is completely worth the money! It's not the highest quality pillow, and truth be told, if you want to keep it in good shape and not kill yourself trying to get the cover on and off, I would spring and buy the pillow case. That aside, it has saved me during my pregnancy. I have a smaller frame so all of the extra weight has caused me a bit of back pain and discomfort in my belly, but this pillow really ensures maximum comfort when sleeping. Furthermore, it is also really great for the nights that you must sleep sitting up due to the heartburn and acid reflux that accompanies pregnancy. The nights that I go to sleep nauseous or with reflux, I stay asleep and wake up feeling better because the pillow keeps my neck propped up. It is a bit large, and there have been nights that my husband has felt like there was a 3rd person sleeping in our bed because of it, but besides that, it's the best.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I'm 25 weeks pregnant currently, and sleeping has become incredibly difficult, especially since I'm a back sleeper.  Sleeping on my side causes parts of my body to fall asleep, and while some of that may be because we need to get a new bed, I think most of it is because of pregnancy and I'm not in the habit on sleeping on my side.  Since sleeping on your back is a big no-no during pregnancy, I needed a little help - tried extra pillows, but I can't use too many or I'll be sleeping without a husband. When I saw the Snoogle at Babies R Us (for $69!!!!), I knew I had to have one.  Luckily, Amazon usually has the products I need for much lower prices, so I immediately put in an order for one.It came yesterday and I had the first restful night I'd had in several weeks.  I'm able to lay on my upper back, but prop my lower body up so that it's slightly on its side.  It also makes side sleeping more comfortable.  You can bend and fold the pillow in whatever way suits you.  Love it! Will probably use this thing even AFTER I'm pregnant :)",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I am a petite frame 5 2' 107lbs pre-prego, so i first bought the mini version of this pillow, had to send it back it was just too small. But this pillow fits me great! I was so uncomfortable before I got this pillow. It is a bit itchy on my face I just wrapped a soft throw over that part. It keeps me on my side all night, and it's also good for just relaxing watching tv. Great buy for the money I would recommend... I read 100's of reviews b4 I purchased.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This has been a very good purchase, it has made sleep comfortable, and the removable cover is a big plus.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,This pillow is the best.  I am 18 weeks and didn't realized how badly I was sleeping at night until I got a good night sleep with this pillow.  It did not come with a removable cover so be sure to order one.  It takes a few minutes to get the cover on.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"If you are pregnant, buy this pillow. There are so many nights that I wouldn't have been able to sleep without my snoogle. Fair warning to anyone you share a bed with, it will take up a lot of room!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I was hesitant to spend the money on this pillow, but I am SO glad that I did.  At about 5 months pregnant, I was waking up uncomfortable with achy hips from sleeping on my side (I much prefer to sleep on my back).  Since getting this pillow, I have been sleeping through the night and not waking up with pain.  I like to use it with the long side against my back so that I can lean back a little, but still be propped up to remain on my side.  The curve to go between the knees is great.  It works the same as using a regular pillow between the knees except that it stays there if I move around a little.  With a regular pillow, I would wake up with it on the floor.  It is a good size for me at 5'5'', but I could see it being to short for taller women.My only negative is that the curve for the head is too thick for me.  My neck is kinked up when using it.  However, I do like being able to hug it in the front and have a place to rest my arm which helps to keep my back and shoulders straight.  I have been using my regular pillow inside of the head curve for now, but I am going to try to open it up and take out some of the stuffing in the head area, so that I can just use the snoogle without another pillow.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,love the pillow! makes sleeping great! you do have to know which side you want to sleep on before putting it in bed. it has so many positions and uses though.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I love this pillow!! I have to bring it with me when I travel because I can't sleep without it!! Wish they offered more color options off the bat instead of having to purchase a different pillowcase besides white.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Love this pillow! Got it during my first trimester because for some reason I was just not able to sleep anymore, let me say it was a Godsend even then! Now that I am getting bigger I still love it! It's very thick and hasn't flattened out so far. It is also very bendy so it's not a pain to conform to your body.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I like this pillow, I really sleep more comfortable; however in order to make it work for me, I had to modify the top part since it was to high for my head, so I removed some of the foam from the inside.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This saved my back during my pregnancy!  This is soooo comfortable!  I was a little hesitant buying it because of some of the reviews, but I am sooo glad I did.  No pillow lasts forever.  So if you expect this one to, you are kidding yourself.  But this one lasted me my whole pregnancy and is still usable for my next one.  I plan to still use it.  It is actually so comfortable that I thought I would have to get my husband one, cause even he loves how soft it is, and how well it supports your back.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,The best investment so far of my twin pregnancy! I can sleep so comfortably with this pillow! I get a great nights sleep EVERY NIGHT.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I'm pregnant and my hips don't hurt as much from sleeping on my side as they did before the snoogle--i'm excited to cuddle with it as i'm getting into bed.  It's great when i go on my back too b/c the bottom part elevates the legs perfectly.  Only con is i get hot w/ it about 3-4 am , throw it off the bed and go back to pillow btw legs, pillow to hold, and pillow for head.  TRICK--instead of buying a pillow case for it i put my regular case on the part where my head goes and it covers just where it needs to!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This pillow is a God-send for me.  I have had a horrible time sleeping during my pregnancy.  This pillow is so comfortable, keeps me surpported and in the right position all night long.  Only trouble is that when I get up to go the bathroom at night, I come back to find my husband curled up with it!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I got this when I was 16 weeks pregnant (now 19 weeks) because I am a stomach sleeper and was finding it uncomfortable to find another position.  I'm sooo glad I bought it when I did!  I hadn't realized how much being uncomfortable had affected my sleeping, but as soon as I bought this I started falling asleep right away at night, and sleeping very soundly through the night.  I feel much more rested.  I've tried out a couple of positions with it (sleeping facing the long side, sleeping away from it) and both have been incredibly comfortable options.My only problem with this is that it makes getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom trickier, you have to untangle from the pillow and sheets, etc, but it is totally worth it.  The best part about this is that my husband teased me mercilessly about how much I loved this pillow, so I let him try it out once and now he loves it more than me - he takes naps with it and steals in the morning if I leave before him (he also asks me every night if I am going to use it, just in case...).",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"A large, comfortable, and versatile pillow. My wife has loved it for the second half of this pregnancy. It has remained nice and fluffy over the last 3 months, too.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,So helpful to get comfortable at night! Must get for pregnant women! I hesitated to get one but not regretting the decision.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this pillow when I was four months pregnant and I've had it for a month now. I really love this pillow and it has made sleeping a lot more comfortable for me, and keeps me on my left side. The best thing about this pillow is that you can put it into different positions to accomodate you. Whether you want to sit up, lay down, or prop your feet up - this pillow works wonders! One reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because there is an inner crease/stiching where the head goes, and sometimes if you lay on that area unknowingly in your sleep, it will cause you some discomfort. Maybe wraping the stitched area with a blanket will help reduce the discomfort if you lay near that area. My husband and I share a queen sized bed, and we have no problem with the size of the pillow. He's also able to wrap his arms around me at night as well. Perfect pillow - must get for pregnant women...or none pregnant!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My husband ordered this pillow for me for Valentine's Day! I love it, it is so supportive and it keeps me from twisting and turning in the bed. I sleep with it everynight. I just wish they made covers for them that was easy to get off. That would have to be the only downfall.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,This is my absolutely favorite pregnancy buy. I sleep with it every night and am so uncomfortable without it. It's hard to explain why it's so good but basically your body just needs more support. It also helps with my pregnancy-related sciatica. Just so worth it.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,Fantastic comfort pillow I bought to get me through my twin pregnancy & beyond! Will be assisting breast feeding also.  Great how you can just snuggle up with it & keep your knees apart whilst side sleeping. Haha great contraceptive too ;). Really helping me get some decent sleep.  Have recommended it to a client of mine that has a hip replacement & recurrent back issues.  Love it!,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I got this pillow while I was in my first trimester and I am now in my third and still sleeping like a baby! Definitely a must have for the expecting mom!,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I love this pillow. It's a little bit on the large size, but I can't sleep without it. I have spd and this pillow is the inky thing that allows me to sleep!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,If it wasn't for this pillow I do not know how I would sleep. Highly recommended!!Thank you for saving me.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Very comfy.. You should buy when u r expecting ... i bought it for my wife..She was having a lot of trouble getting comfortable and sleeping through the night about 20 weeks into my pregnancy. She tried everything, proping a pillow between my knees, one under my side, etc...I was so uncomfortable. I finally decided to break down and spend the money on this pillow and I can't begin to tell you how much it has helped. She love the fact that it wraps around my back and come between my legs and also under my head all at the same time. Yes, the reviews about the pillow flattening out are true but I just fluff mine back up. There were also complaints about when you want to flip over on your other side, it's hard to adjust the pillow. She just flip her body over and don't move the pillow. It's just as comfortable. It does take up a lot of room in the bed but She can't stress that a good night sleep is so worth it for a pregnant lady. I think this is a must have during pregnancy. It also helps when you have back pain...",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,She loves itI no longer get my ears worn out with how horrible it is to be pregnant and trying to sleep (I used to get this when I was trying to sleep too....)She's happy - My ears are happy - I'm happyJust buy it for gods sake...:) ladies we love you all really,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"If I wasn't already happily married, I would be walking down the aisle for the fourth time with this beautiful pillow!  What else can I say. Love it, love it, love it!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I recently got this pillow and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is! I can finally sleep! I'm 18 weeks, and I've been using 4-5 pillows a night to try and get comfortable. I haven't been able to fall asleep on my left side like is recommended; I've been sleeping sitting up and after the first bathroom wake-up I could sleep on my side. With this I was comfortable instantly and fell right asleep. I aslo fell back asleep after getting up to use the restroom right away (which is new!) It is incredibly comfortable, and easy to move around with if you like to flip over. It also comes with a sheet that shows you tons of different ways to use it (more than is shown online!) I adore it!!! Worth every penny! **I'd like to add, now that my daughter is 7 months old, that I adored that pillow all through my pregnancy, it was a God-send!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"The pillow is nice and my wife enjoys it, but I have noticed after only a month or two that it is already compressed in some areas. I thought it would have better quality foam. We'll be lucky if this pillow lasts through the entire pregnancy.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This is the best body pillow ever for pregnant women!  I haven't had any trouble sleeping througout my pregnancy, and I'm convinced it's because of the Snoogle.  It provides just the right support.  It is pretty large and takes up quite a bit of bed space, so it may not work for those with a small bed.  It can also make it difficult to get out of bed if you place long side of the Snoogle against the outside edge of the bed.  But if you can spare the space and are willing to work a little harder to get out of the bed in exchange for hours of quality sleep, I'd definitely recommend this pillow!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This pillow is wonderful. I only gave 4 stars due to the horrible texture and design of the pillow cover. The pillow itself is great. I was worried that it would not work for me as I am almost 6 feet tall but it works perfectly. I am usually a tummy sleeper and I got this to help with side sleeping during pregnancy. It really cradles my entire body and I have no need for other pillows while sleeping. It is also great for sitting up in bed, it is a great investment. I am hesitant to buy replacement covers from the manufacture because the one it came with (white/cream cover) is truly not quality. The material is rough and cheap feeling.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"If you are pregnant, heck, even if you're not, I would recommend buying this pillow. It saved my back, my knees, and my hips during my entire pregnancy. I used it everyday and still do! SUPER HIGHLY recommended....",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Bought this pillow after fighting with 3-4 different pillows each night.  Had a hard time with the head piece.  It was too thick because I like a flat pillow.  But, I kept flattening it down. Loved the flexible bottom part. I'm 5'7"" and had no trouble with the length.  It was perfect to fit under my stomach when I got bigger.  It takes up less space in the bed and my husband can cuddle up with me and the pillow from behind.  Wouled recommend looking at other sites to find the cheapest version. Got mine on sale for about $...  Make sure it comes with the pillow case!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I was a belly sleeper and this pillow has helped me get a good night's sleep.  It is so nice that you don't have to constantly adjust it through the night as you change position.  So great that I take it along when we travel if I can!,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Got this as a prenatal gift for an expecting mom. This is similar to pillows we use at our massage spa as part of a prenatal massage session. They are super comfy and do a great job of supporting every part of your prego friend or wife! Makes for happy pregnant women, so a great buy!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Really great pillow, I suffer from chronic back pain and sleeping was always a challenge, could never get comfortable.  But this pillow really helps, I should give it 5 stars but the pillow case is difficult to pull on and off...but how I sleep really makes up for that one annoying thing.I would recommend for people (even non-pregnant ones) that it does helps.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,This pillow is a must for pregnancy.  It also can be positioned to use while sitting up among other positions.  Don't buy the basic one because the cover is scratchy.  I should've paid more for the knit cover.  The basic works as long as you put a pillow case on both ends.,4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I got this for my wife who is pregnant with twins and she loves this thing. And I borrow it from time to time too.,5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I am really enjoying the snoogle.  It has helped me get comfortable enough to sleep better.  When I am not fighting my kitties for it, I actually get a good night's rest.  I would just warn people that once they are comfortable in their snoogle, it makes it a hazard to get out of for all those night bathroom trips.  My only other suggestion would be that the stuffing be fuller.  After a while, the snoogle gets a little flattened, so you have to fluff it.  Otherwise, I love it!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this pillow for my wife at the start of her fourth pregnancy. She had been sleeping with numerous standard pillows and tossed and turned all night. She tells me often that this pillow makes a world of difference and provides much better support.My kids love using it for watching movies, too! The large size of the pillow makes it perfect for lounging around.I highly recommend this pillow to anyone who currently uses or is looking at purchasing a body pillow.",5,1

"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",These pads are a great way of protecting the environment. They fit in the bra snugly and are easily washable.,5,1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","I don't leak very much, so I find these useful.  Less wasteful and can be reused several times before washing.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","i read a lot of reviews on here...i didn't want to waste my money on a product that wouldn't work.  I started with disposables (got the linsonah on sale for $1 - so i thought i would try them) but didn't like the regular cost or the wastefulness.Got these from babies r us for the same price as amazon.  and overall, i'm happy with them.  the diameter is a little smaller than that of the disposable, and sometimes they shift around in my bra and don't cover the nipple - but the same thing would happen with the disposable.i feel they absorb just as well, or better, than the disposable.  Either that or i'm producing less milk than in the beginning (my baby is currently three weeks old), but i'm not leaking through to my shirt nearly as often - maybe once every other day.I do change them frequently to avoid leakage.  I just use some soap in the bathroom sink, press between towel layers to soak up excess moisture and lay out to dry.  I have not ""run out"" with this method.For $7, i'm happy with my purchase.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",they defiantly come in handy and i will use them when i have more kids. they are a defiant need,5,1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","Bought these by chance to try and ended up loving them.  They don't lay the nicest in your bra, but save some serious dough by not having to use the disposable ones.  Would recommend washing before first use though :)  Highly recommended.",4,1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",Loved these. they stood up to numerous washings (free in a regular wash cycle) and stayed put during wear better than any other brands. And they look almost brand new and ready for next time,5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,this was great easy to use n fits  on dresser or bathroom counter nicely  very hhandy n easy to clean,5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"For our first daughter, we had the skip hop toolbox diaper caddy (which is $40-50).  It was such a pain and didn't hold everything we needed (in a compact space).  So for our 2nd baby, I searched for the right diaper organizer for our changing table.  I came across this one on amazon.  The price was good, it was gender neutral - so I decided to try it.  It is perfect!  It organizes everything you need for the changing table (easy access for diapers, creams, wipes) in a small compact space.  I should've bought this one for our first baby!  What a great value!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"I love this diaper organizer. I have the munchkin wipes warmer and it sits on top just fine. I don't have any problems with it sliding around or lifting up when I remove a wipe. I love that I can remove the side containers, I have both of mine sitting on one side because of the size of my changing table and it works great. Between the two side containers I have a large JJ lotion, a tube of aquafor, butt paste, thermometer, bulb syringe, nail clippers and a tiny container of Vaseline. The bulb syringe is kind of hanging out the top but other than that everything fits just fine.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"I really like this changing station organizer- I didn't think to put it on my registry an saw it when I was shopping on Amazon for other items. I really like having everything out in reach, makes changing my little one in the middle of the night even easier when I'm half asleep. It's a good size too- it doesn't take up too much room and fits the lionheart wipes warmer perfectly.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"This helped turn the top of our bureau into a changing table. It holds the wipes, diapers, diaper cream, etc. and keeps everything organized and easy to access!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"This is a handy little diaper holder. It holds wipes and diapers and the compartments on the sides hold miscellaneous items. I wish the side compartments (which are removable) were more sturdy, but other than that it's fine.",4,1
"Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor","I had read reviews of this monitor and was very skeptical.  I had a monitor by Fisher Price and it hummed constantly, not allowing us to hear our son when he cried. My husband and I decided to purchase this monitor, not having remembered the reviews it received.  I must say, we are pleased with the monitor.  It does make some static now and again, but this is normal for any type of radio transmitted device.  I simply turn the monitor off, then back on again and it resolves the problem.  What I have noticed is that when I have it on channel B in the babies room and on channel A in the bedroom or living room (easy to do accidentally), there is a lot of static but you can still hear the baby.  I would like to believe the previous poor reviews have been due to &quot;operator error&quot; but there are so many, it's hard to say.  The only downside I find with this monitor is that even when the volume is on the lowest setting, it is still quite sensitive to baby noises - but better to be safe than sorry!",4,1
"Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor","I would recommend this monitor to anyone with a two story home or basement.  All 3 parts can either use batteries or can plug-in.  So, you can clip one of the receivers to you, if you are outside.  You can one receiver on in the basement and another on in the kitchen. That way, you can get other stuff done without having to constantly check with the monitor.Also, the volume control can be set very loud, so you can hear every sound or set it lower, if you are just listening for crying.I like how the monitor piece has the ring, it hooks nicely to a post on the crib.",5,1
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"I purchased these for my second baby hoping I can save money on regular diapers and also do my part in not creating more waste in landfills. I've used these since my daughter was a newborn and now she's six months old. I love the fact that i can reuse them, when i wash them they're clean and i've saved a lot of money on boxes of diapers. Two things were a little hard to deal with at first, these are good for the baby since they are cotton but i found that they leaked through the sides so i didnt use these for night use since my daughter rolls over quite a bit. Also, as many of you may wonder, washing poop off of these kinda sucks. When they're breast fed, it was no biggy but once she started eating solids...yeah, you have to clean them off before washing them. I didnt clean them completely, just enough to where the bulky parts were off...then i rinsed w/vinegar in cold water, then ran a regular cycle w/ a little bit of detergent. Trust me, the poop comes off and you cant even tell which diaper was the poopy one! I still use them and will continue because the regular diapers are such a waste!",4,1
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"Product arrived earlier than expected :) Exactly what I had ordered - the perfect solution to my disposable diaper woes, these are the simplest reusables. Holding up great especially considering the dozens of times I've washed them already! Very happy Momma and baby!",5,1
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"I used these diapers for my first child.  They are extremely durable and very well made.  I did not have any leaks with these diapers and do not have any stains or tears from having used them for over a year now.  I found that if I thew in a dry towel with the diapers in the dryer, they would dry much quicker.  I have a large deck and often times I would dry the diapers and inserts on my deck out in sun, then throw them in the dryer later to soften them up.  With my second child I've switched to BumGenius diapers.  The thing about Kushies diapers is that once the diaper is wet, it's wet.  I wish the inner lining of Kushies was a fleece liner, to wick away the moisture (the way BumGenius diapers are).  You can't beat Kushies' price.  But if you want a diaper that will keep your baby's skin dry against the diaper, you don't want Kushies.  BumGenius has been wonderful because it's keeps my baby's bottom nice and dry and it comes in a size that grows with your child (10lbs-35lbs)",4,1
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"I PURCHSED TWO PACKS OF THESE AND SOME POCKETS. These beat pockets by far theyare very absorbent Im very glad i found a great diaper at an amazing low price i  am planning on buying more. Pockets just didnt aborb alot, they leaked and if i stuffed them with more liners they were to bulky on my son.I also like how these have the convenience of a pocket incase i need more protection.",5,1
Kushies CLASSIC Infant Cloth Diapers 5 PK (10-22lbs),"Kushies Ultras are superior because 1. they don't get damp on the outside and 2. Ultras have a larger tag of Velcro, which makes adjustments a lot easier.",4,1
Kushies Baby 3-Roll Pack Flushable-Biodegradable Diaper Liners,"When we found out that we were pregnant with our second child,  we decided to switch to cloth diapers... something I thought I would NEVER do.  It is SO much easier than I thought it would be.  I love the All-in-One cloth diapers and these liners make it even easier.  My husband was a bit iffy on the switch, but he admits that the liners make it worth it.  I have noticed that one side of the liner is slightly rougher than the other, it's easy to feel the difference.  My son doesn't have a problem with diaper rash as long as I put the smoother side facing his bottom.",5,1
Baby Bjorn&reg; Large Potty Chair White,"My son is a little over 2, and we love this potty! The splash guard is high enough to keep everything in the potty. He loves being able to sit down on his own without any help from us. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little wider. My son is 36 inches tall and 30 lbs, I'm afraid he may outgrow it before he's ready for the real toilet.",5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"This duck is awesome not only for the baby but also for daddy.My baby is a little over 17 month now and he loves to play in his duck not only during bath time but also in his room. It is a lot more comfortable to take a bath in the duck because it doesn't feel as cold as the bath tub, it also safes a lot of water since you don't need to fill a whole bath tub and there is a protective ""air pillow"" around him.You can also fill the duck with ice and use it as a beer cooler which is a real party hit.The little hot sign never really worked and shows HOT as soon as you fill it with water instead of ice cubes. Maybe thats because the duck is actually intended to be a beer cooler.So this really should be on your shopping list together with food, clothes, diapers and toys...",5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,Bought this for our 2-months trip. I love the temperature indicator inside (shows when water too hot). Inflated kept the pressure for all the stay (2 months). Highly recommended.,5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"I bought this on a trip and loved it. Its great because it holds the babies' head and is safer than other tubs. The duck's mouth makes noises, its fun an my baby feels free to play and move. I will use it for everyday, not just to travel.",5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"This picture makes it look neon green which is the only reason I was hesitant to buy it.  My son is 15 months, 32 inches long and 26 lbs. and this was too small for him.  It's very cute and well made so I will keep this so I can fill it up with water on hot days for him to splash in.",5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"Our daughter takes most of her baths in the kitchen sink as it used to be the only place she would bathe without screaming the whole time.  Now that we have the ducky tub and have started using it, she loves it and has a great time.  We still do baths in the sink (easier to wash her hair), but most of our baths are in the ducky; the quacking makes her laugh!  I must have the water at the right temp all the time though - I've never seen the ""hot"" indicator react at all, which is not the case with our rubber ducky temp indicator.  Still, it's a great little tub!",4,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,Love it! There's just enough room for my 6 month old to splash around and sit up on his own.,5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"When my daughter got too old for her bath seat I decided to purchases a """"transitional"""" tub to ease her into the big tub. She loved this! I think it also helped in her liking baths in the big tub because she never once seemed scared of the transition when she got too big for this duck.",5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,This is an excellent transition from the baby bath. The bottom is not slippery and my boy has fun during his bath. It airs up easily and the drain plug works very well. We love it.,5,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,Works great for babies that can sit up on there own. I purchased it for my 6month old and she loves it.,5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"My son was born 51/2 weeks early, and as a result I had to use a breastpump 8 times a day until he could breastfeed.  I consider myself something of an expert now, after all of that, and I adore this handpump!  I was nervous about giving up my hospital grade rental once he was home and breasfeeding exclusively, but this pump really is amazing.  I use it at least once a day, so that Dad can feed him, too, and it is very efficient. My first handpump left me in tears, but I swear this pump works almost as well as the hospital's, with a little hand workout to boot!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I have a 3 month old baby and this pump is great for someone like me!  I'm a stay at home Mom that only works one day on the weekend.  So, I basically only need to pump 2 days a week and on certain, rare occasions.  In the beginning, I had a medium brand electric breast pump...I spent about $130.00.  It was great to use at home, but I was so embarassed to use it anywhere else.  It was soo noisy and a bit of a pain to find a comfy place to plug in to.  So, a few embarassing and noisy pumps later I opted to try the manual Isis Breast Pump.  It works great and is so quiet!!!  I love it!  I have a bigger chest and have no problems with the fitting or suction.  It works great!  I also love using the Avent bottles, so this pump seems perfect for me.  I do believe that if you're a more serious pumper and need to pump a lot, a dual electric pump would probably work better.  But if you're someone like me, or just need a simple quiet pump to take out for certain occasions, this pump is GREAT!On another note:  My electric pump quit sucking already.  I used it 2 nights ago at home and the hose inside split and cracked.  I'm glad I had this one on hand!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"The Isis Breast Pump has worked so great for me! Before I had the Isis, I hated to pump. I have purchased 2 other pumps before I bought the Isis Breast Pump. I bought the Madela Manual Pump and the Madela Single Deluxe Electric/Battery Pump. I found it difficult to produce milk with the Madela pumps. With the Isis, it is SO easy for me to pump 8oz of milk within 20 minutes! That is a lot compared to what I was able to pump with the Madela Pumps (only about 2oz each session!). The Isis is so comfortable and it totally promotes let down!! This pump is also easy to clean, no little nooks and crannies that are impossible to get to like in some other pumps. I highly recommend the Isis Pump...you will be very happy with it! I wish I bought this pump 7 months ago! Now pumping is so easy for me.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,I love this pump.  I've used it for over a year for my two children that were born very close together.  Just now have I needed a replacement white thingy.  Even though they cost more as a SAHM it's great that the bottles fit straight from the pump to the freezer.  I don't pump a lot but I can store and save what I need and it's all very convienient.,4,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"When I first tried this I thought the poor reviews were correct and I had wasted my money. Within a few minutes though, I had figured out how to use it and found it works better, for me, than my double electric medela pump-in-style. I have never had great luck with breast pumps so I was disappointed the medelas didn't work for me. This is awesome! I barely feel a thing yet it extracts milk even without a let-down!For occasional pumping this is going to be exactly what I need. I can use it with one hand while my baby is on the other side, something incredibly awkward with the electric medela. I also had constantly to readjust the suction on the medela and in order to get milk, even during a let-down, had to turn it painfully high. I barely feel this and have far greater control over the speed of the suction. With no need to adjust the suction strength itself, this pump is so easy to use.At first I was afraid nothing was happening; then I realized that I needed to push the pump into the breast a bit to make the soft horn work. Perhaps that is the problem other reviewers experienced. In less than five minutes I had two ounces from one side- something that I rarely achieved with the medela, even when absent from the baby and keeping the pump on for 40 minutes!I'm more pleased than I can say!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,I highly recommend this breast pump.  It works faster than the Medela electric pump that I have.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes the pump loses suction but the spare parts quickly fix that problem.,4,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I have two of these Avent pumps - have been pumping since my little guy was two weeks old (wanted to build up a supply).  I do admit, my wrists got sore at first (double pumping) - so I caved in a bought the Medela.  I used it for a month and went back to my manual pumps (your arms get used to the ""work out"").  I feel I get more milk out with the manuals and I pump up to 6 times a day - I am able to express about 30 - 40 ounces of milk each day.  I know each woman is very different regarding let down and expressing, but I really do think this is a superior product to Medela in that it lets you control the speed at which you pump (you can pump in ""let down"" mode the whole time if you wish) - just really pleased with this model.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I knew I wanted to breastfeed my son and going back to work worried me.  My husband and I went out and spend almost three hundred dollars on an electric pump.  I was well endowed before my pregnancy, so I am now a G cup.  The electric pump would now work for me no matter what.  It didn't seem to be designed for a large breast.  I did some research and came across the Isis.  I bought one, and life is good!  It works better then I could have hoped!  It is also a ton quieter then the electric one (that is really important because when I pump at work, there are people right outside the room.  I have been using this now for 9 months, and still love it!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"Once I learned how to use this breast pump (learning the suction technique of it)  I absolutely love it.  I am a stay at home mom but wanted something affordable, easy to use, and easy to tote to pump milk to have for outings and so that my husband would be able to feed our daughter too.  Once let down occurs, I have easily gotten 4 ounces in a matter of 10 minutes or even less.  I would recommend this pump to anyone who wants to save money but would like to find a pump that they can depend on.  I was unsure of purchasing a pump before we had our daughter because they tend to be expensive and some do not work for everyone.  After reading the reviews on the isis I found that it probably is the best on the market.  I would'nt trade it for an electric pump as I have also read that others felt the same way.  It is also great to know that all avent bottles easily screw on to the pump.  So as you need to use bigger bottles it is just a matter or purchasing them and hooking them up.  The avent isis pump is easy to clean, easy to take apart, and put back together.  I hope that whoever purchases this is as happy as I have been.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I used both this pump and the Medela PIS while I was breastfeeding.  What I liked better about this pump than my electric was its portability, how easy it was to clean, and its quick letdown.  I would put this in my purse and liked having it available in case I couldn't nurse my daughter, or for when I had a business meeting and would need to pump.  It really came in handy on our first airplane trip-- my daughter refused to nurse, and we didn't carry formula with us.  I was able to pump her a bottle and feed her while we were in the air, making everyone happy. :)  The PIS needs to be handwashed and sterilized, but you can put the Avent pump in the dishwasher, which made things much easier.  The only downside to this pump is having to manually pump it, and the creaking sound mine made as I pumped.  But, I would definitely recommend it, especially if you don't have alot of money to spend on an electric.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,My girl friend just had our baby and it has been kind of frusterating when the baby keeps falling asleep on her bossoms. So we decided to try an electric pump which really was a piece of garbage. Thats when we decided to get the avent manual pump which worked wonders. This pump sucked out 4 oz of milke within 5 minutes. I really recomend this pump to all existing and new parents. The price was great and the effectiveness of the pump was even greater. Thanks so much Avent.,5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"This product has made my life so much better. I have recently returned to work and wanted to make sure that I could still feed my baby 100% breast milk. (She's only 3mo old.) I had been trying to use a double electric pump for a few weeks before my return and really wasn't have much luck with it. Sometimes I'd get 1T, other times I'd get 2oz. And, this is after 45min pumping sessions, lots of massage, listening to recordings of my crying baby, etc, etc.I was in pain and I was very frustrated.I had read about the massage petals of the Avent and thought it'd be worth a try. Their advertising is spot on, I'm able to pump a full feeding for my baby in 20 mins. With each pumping session, I see between 3-5oz. Wow. My baby won't starve now. It's also very comfortable, I tried so many sizes of shields before, but the petal massager is perfect.Pros:1. Petal massager is comfortable2. Produces a fast let down3. Easy to control the suction/cycle speed4. Small/compact -- easy to carry around & you're not tethered to one spot in your home.5. No electricity required6. Low price7. Quiet compared to electric pumps8. Less equipment than an electric pump9. Actually WORKS!!!Cons:1. One side at a time2. I use both hands while I pump3. Squeaks loudHere's some feedback for the product design though:1. Some milk gets wasted because of the large space before the valve. I usually swish it around to make sure that all the milk drains into the bottle.2. There is some squeaking that occurs with each pump. I think this is because the handle rubs against the plastic cap.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I work full-time and pump at least twice while at work.  This pump is great and has withstood much traveling and cleaning.  It's comfortable and super-easy.  I get 5-6 ounces at a time in under 10 minutes.  After pumping, I ""pump"" soap and water through it to clean it out.  Before pumping I'm a D-cup and have no trouble with suction.  I'm careful to attach the bottles or the plastic storage cups correctly and do not have a problem with leakage.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I *love* this pump, it saved my nursing relationship in those early days.  I'm a stay-at-home mom of one baby, so I had no reason to get an electric pump and this was a nice pump for the price.  I liked that the bottles would screw right onto the base, or you could screw the storage cases in using a neck.  There's no extra parts need to buy at all!  Assembly was easy once you learned how to do it, and I could express a lot of milk fast when paired with breast compressions.  I didn't like the massaging insert, so I took it out, and it was nice that it still worked, unlike the Gerber pump.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I originally bought this because I like to go against the flow and really didn't want to spend big money on the big name electric [you know the one :)].  Wow!!  It works sooo well!!  It's quick to use and easy to clean.  I can get just as much milk with this one than I can with the electric one my employer provides for use at work.  The obvious advantage with other styles is the the ability to pump both sides at once -- but this one is exceptional for use early morning, late night, or while the baby is on the other breast.  I would highly recommend this pump -- you don't HAVE to get the big name, big price pump!!!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"At first, I was sceptical about buying this pump since you can only  pump one breast at a time, but I actually like this pump much better than my double electric pump by Medela. First of all, it is easier to set up (no tubing to connect and no plugs or batteries to worry about) and perfect for going back to work or vacationing. This pump is also much more comfortable and easier on the nipples than my medela double select pump. Thanks Avent!",5,1
Boppy Luxe Designer Pillow In Rosebud,"Nursing moms rave over the boppy, but I'm telling you I bottle feed my daughter and this is a wonderful product! Baby is comfortable and supported and your arm won't get tired!  You can cuddle with her and rub her head and face with your free hand.I put her in this for support when she sits up and lies on her belly.  She really likes it a lot more than just setting her down on the floor.  And the luxe is so plush and pretty!  Highly recommended!  And to think I almost passed this one up!",5,1
Boppy Luxe Designer Pillow In Rosebud,This is an essential baby must!!  I don't know what I would do without a Boppy pillow!  My newborn and I love it. I use it with every feeding and it's fun to prop my baby up so she can see me. It provides a great snug feeling during feedings and gives my arms a nice rest.  It's a must have!!,5,1
Avent Bottle with 10 Disposable Liners (8-oz.),"I love avent products.  I can pump into the liners (using the adapter kit, I wasn't able to use the Isis pump)and then freeze it for my husband or daycare provider.  The nipple works great for my daughter, and she switches from bottle to breast with no problems.  My husband loved how easy it was for him - he'd heat up the bag of milk, put the bag into the bottle, put on the nipple from a sterile travel pack, feed her, then toss the liner.  My daughter also loves the pacifiers, and they have a cap to keep them clean!",5,1
InSTEP 5K Single Premium Jogging Stroller,"This stroller is a great buy. My 11 month old son doesn't make a sound the whole ride. He's comfortable and the ride is smooth. The seat even reclines which is nice. Easy to assemble, too. The 16 inch front wheel is the only way to go if you are a runner/jogger and this one is designed well. Target had the best price I've seen on this stroller and I did my research. It's crazy to pay hundreds of dollars for the high end brands and models unless you plan on training for lots of marathons. This one is perfect for the 5K or 10K runner in my opinion, or anyone who jogs or walks for exercise.",5,1
InSTEP 5K Single Premium Jogging Stroller,This is a great looking stroller and has a lot of places for my junk.  I like that.  But it is not good for walking on the pavement because is is too hard to turn because it is not the swivel wheel.  It is great on the dirt/stone path that I go jogging on.  The other thing was with the hand brake.  It took my husband a long time to figure out how to get it to work correctly.  It was not working when we first set up the stroller.,4,1
InSTEP 5K Single Premium Jogging Stroller,"Granted, this isnt the GREATEST jogging stroller you could buy, but for the price its great! I dont jog much with it but i walk alot and it has been perfect! I walk on side roads and its really easy to meneuver even on a curvy road. I never had a problem when i did jog with it either. I like this stroller alot!",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We originally bought this tub because it looked the safest with the infant cradle and we aggree that it is. My daughter loves to ""hang out"" in it with her feet off the sides in the water, and it allows me to use both hands to bathe her. Whether we use it in the tub or on the counter top, I feel that she is secure in the cradle and she LOVES taking baths. We have even used it in the tub with her 5year old sister! She is still too small to remove the cradle, but I am sure that we will continue to love it as she grows. It is a must have!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I tried several other tubs before we landed on this one. The reclined infant seat is fantastic and allows baby to relax while he enjoys his bath.  There's plenty of room for him to splash and play.  I use the tub on my bathroom countertop next to the sink.  When we're finished with the bath, I just lift up one end and pour the water into the sink.  It's easier than using the drainage plug.  I've given this tub as a gift to all the new Mommies I know!  I'd definitely put it on my &quot;must have&quot; list for a new baby!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We tried everything to get our baby to enjoy bath time, and this tub was the golden ticket! She feels very safe & secure in the little baby sling and for the first time ever actually enjoys bath time. Unfortunately it does not fit our sink, but I still give it 5 stars.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","Our daughter is 8 weeks old and we have been using this tub since she was 2 weeks old.  She is still in the sling and I love that aspect of the tub.  She is cradled in the water and feels secure.  I haven't tried the tub with an older child, but LOVE it for our newborn!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I listed this tub on my registry.  Frankly, I had no idea which tub to pick out and went with this one because of the ratings. We have been using this tub regularly for the past four months and arequite pleased.  Our daughter rests in the sling, and doesn't everslide down.  Moreover, it fits perfectly in our--two sink--kitchensink.  When she's a bit older, we will likely purchase a differentmodel, but this one has been great thus far.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We just had our first baby 2 1/2 months ago.  I researched many tub options and registered for this one.  I'm very happy with it.  The ""hammock"" helped support my newborn, and he seemed very comfortable in it.  I just started using it without the hammock now that my son is a little bigger.  The non-slip back and hump in the middle keep him from sliding too much.  I also like the storage area on the side and the drain plug that changes colors if the water is too hot.  Bathtime is enjoyable because of this tub!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is a cute and Great tub. I love the features it has. Fits in sink perfect, love the drain plug and the soft insert for the infants.The toddler Area I've yet to use, but it seems like it will come in handy!Angela",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I loved this tub for my baby when she was newborn.  The hammock was perfect. It also fits on other baby tubs.  We gave it to my sister when her baby was born.  The biggest complaint I have is the ""hump"" in the middle of the tub.  My ""little girl"" is BIG (5 months).  She's tall and chunky.  She doesn't sit up well yet so we are still using the reclined side and she is so long that she scoots over the hump and gets very uncomfortable. Other than that it has been a wonderful tub, but I would reconsider if you have a big baby.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I was given this tub as a shower gift.  I luv it!  I had registered on Babie's R Us' website for a collapsable tub to make storage easier, and someone also gave that to me.  But in reading some reviews on it, some people said it leaked....well back to the store that went (unopened).  I kept this one because I liked the idea of the sling for a newborn and I liked the fact that it has the stopper that is supposed to change color if the water is too hot.  Well my daughter hated taking a bath in the sling.  Each time I put her in it, she looked terrified as if she was going to fall out of it.  Eventually, she started to hang a leg off the sling as if to brace herself (it was kinda funny to see her doing that :).  But I finally decided, enough is enough and started giving her baths without the sling and she now likes to take a bath.  I like the padding for her back and the contoured floor so she won't slip.  Now, I think she really looks forward to taking a bath.  Also, because of my odd shaped kitchen sink, the tub wouldn't fit into it, so I just set this tub up in her room on her changing table with a towel under it.  It works out really great.  I am very pleased with this tub and now, so is Anisa.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",I love this tub. The sling makes giving my month old daughter a bath very easy. At first I filled it up full enough to touch her back but found that when she would slide herself down a little it would get to close to her mouth so I drained it a little and it works great. I love that is has the holder at the end as well. I put everything I need in it so I never forget anything.,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I got this bathtub as a gift and I love how I can give my little baby girl a bath in the kitchen. This tub fits perfectly in my double sink. She is right at perfect height. My only complaint is the green back really doesn't prevent baby from sliding, I have to place a small hand towel behind her back for every bath, or else she is sliding all over.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We bought this tub to replace the tub to seat universal system, which was just a nightmare.  By the time we bought it, however, my daughter was too big to use the sling, but I fold it up and use it as a pillow for her head.  She had her first tearless bath recently, and I couldnt be happier! She stays in place even while kicking her feet, and I don't have to scoot her up constantly. The plug fits easily without leaking. Would definitely recommend.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","Unquestionably the best bathtub to keep your little baby secure while you use both hands to bathe him.  I was so nervous to give my baby a bath by myself, but after we went and bought this tub, I've never been more confident about it.  The hammock makes him feel very secure.  Great product!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","My little guy is only 6 weeks old, but so far I really like this tub.  I only used the sling until he was about 4 weeks old, but he was a 9 pounder.  Smaller babies should be able to use the sling longer.  His butt did seem to hit the plastic part in the middle while in the sling, but probably was due to his size, and it seemed to bother ME more than it did him!  Now I am using the infant reclining part, and it's working out well.  I use the tub on my bathroom sink counter, but he's already learning to splash, so will have to move it to the bathtub SOON!  Haven't used the toddler part yet, so can't comment.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",This is the best bathtub out there trust me! You don't even have to use the sling unless your child is very small. Our son can't hold his head up but he sits in it perfectly. The back cradles our son and his head perfectly. Don't waste your time and money on any other tub!,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","...and we do too. We've had this since our daughter was born and started using it around 3 weeks. The infant insert works absolutely great. We used it until she was 2 1/2 months old and around 9 1/2 pounds. Our LO is petite but very strong and at about 21 inches + she would arch her back and also push her feet  to the tub's edge when she was on the net, which was a little dangerous, so we decided to remove it and bathe her on the baby side since she cannot sit up on her own yet. She loves that side now! The water is deep enough to keep her warm and happy as she kicks her legs and arms, but not so deep as to reach over her belly. Still, someone needs to be there at all times. Needless to say the tub needs to be cleaned at least once a week. And a funny sorta funny note: If the water is warm your baby may poop while in it (she will definitely pee) so keep an eye on that too! I didn't give it 5 stars because it is kinda bulky and definitely does not fit under some (I would say many) tubs. For us that was not a problem, but I can see how others may consider this inconvenient",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This tub is a lifesaver.  It allows you to bath your newborn without any help, thanks to the hammock feature.  It is also a great buy.  I would highly recommend this tub and no other.I would like to address some of the complaints I saw in some of the other reviews.  The size is fine.  You can't get a more ""compact"" tub.  After all, your baby does have to fit in it.  You should never trust the plug anyway.  Just use a good thermometer.  And all you have to do is turn the tub to get rid of any excess water after draining the majority of it by unplugging it.  So, there are no significant complaints with this product.  It does the job and well.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","My baby is now almost 11 months old and is probably too big to really bathe in this tub anymore; however I continue to use it because it's just so easy to pop it on top of the kitchen sink and fill it up. He sits up in it now and splashes and enjoys bath-time. We bought several other bath tubs and this one won out, hands down.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","What else can I say? I like it for these reasons: It is very cheap. When I went to buy it, I was expecting it to be a lot more, since it seemed to have so many great features. The bath cradle is a great idea, and the non-slip head (and butt!) rests just makes life easier when you have to bath the baby by yourself and don't have any help! Just a footnote: In my opinion, it is not too bulky like someone else was saying (you can't get much smaller if you want any room to put your baby in).",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is the best tub out there, we have 4 kids and have had several different tubs, this has been the best.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We love this tub..the great accessory is the hammock that attaches for newborn use. Being new parents, it is a little overwhelming trying to hold a soapy slippery baby while trying to also bathe her. This hammock keeps the baby slightly submerged in the water, while keeping her nestled in the hammock. Truly makes bathing an infant a much easier task then if you were trying to hold them yourself. Fits right over the kitchen sink (we have double sink and it fits perfectly) Not sure about the accuracy of the water plug that is supposed to change colors if the water is too hot...better to just test the water yourself to be safe.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub.  Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer.  The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water).  Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",By far the best baby bathtub out there! I highly recommend it especially at this price.  You won't regret it.,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I changed my mind on which baby bathtub to register for several times before I decided on this one. It turned out to be a great choice for us!For the first month, we used the hammock-type newborn attachment. I was too nervous to put my son in the tub without it while I was still getting the hang of things. He never looked quite comfortable in it though; his chin was bent into his chest. I adjusted the hammock several times without much improvement. He didn't seem to mind, though, and the hammock was a great help.Once I moved him to the infant (reclined) side of the tub, he looked more comfortable. His bottom slips out of place sometimes when he arches his back, but never to the point where he'd slide all the way down. (Of course, you should never leave your baby unattended in any type of tub.)I use this tub on my bathroom counter, but I can see how it would fit conveniently in the kitchen sink. However, bathtime at our house is after dinner, at which time our kitchen sink is usually full of dishes! I fill it from the bathroom sink using a large cup, and fill the sink itself with clean water to rinse. I put some baby wash in the small reservoir on the end of the tub and add warm water. I use this soapy water to wash the baby instead of putting the soap directly on the washcloth or on his skin. It wouldn't be very convenient to use this basin for rinse water because it doesn't hold much. I rinse with water from the sink using the same big cup I filled the tub with.The drain plug is very secure and we've had no problem with leaks. When bathtime is over and baby is safe in his crib, I move the edge of the tub over the sink and pull the plug to let it drain. Then we store the tub in the regular bathtub!This is a good tub for a good price.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",I ordered for a friend. She got it and said it was super cute. She has not said she has had any problems with it. So I guess its good.,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is a fantastic baby bathtub. Fits perfectly in our kitchen sink, and can be plopped into the grownup tub, too. It gets baby through all stages, from infant to toddler. The sling/hammock that comes with it is particularly good for newborns/infants. The sling can be tossed in the washing machine. The tub has a nice holder on the end for bottles of soap and shampoo. Great tub. Can't imagine anything better.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I have had friends who said they wished they had just gone with this tub in the beginning, rather than trying several and finally settling on this tub.  We were happy with it from day one.  We used it in the bedroom with the newborn hammock for the first couple of weeks.  We have used it in several different kitchen sinks, and it fits really well.  It is definitely a back-saver -- we tried using it inside the big bathtub, and we nearly broke our backs trying to bathe him that way.  We continued to use it once my baby could sit in the toddler side, around 4 or 5 months.  I've heard people say that their baby was ""too big"" for the tub, but my boy was always big and long for his age, and he never had any problems.  He was around 10 months old when we finally tried to find a bath seat for him to use in the big bathtub (see my other reviews), but we would gladly have continued to use the Sure Comfort.  The only real reason for switching is my son was getting way too active, and in our cramped kitchen we spent most of the bath prying our little monkey's hands off the faucet, etc., and hauling him back into the tub.  He was just ready for the big tub experience.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",Great tub for newborns. The net makes the shower process easier and my baby feels safe. Great size and fits on top of small counters. I would recommend this item.,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I looked at several different tubs, including some more expensive ones, before purchasing this one.  Now I am very glad I did not buy one of the more pricey models.  I love this tub.  My daughter was only 5 pounds when she was born, and I was afraid she might be too small for a tub, but this one worked really well.  In fact, mine did not come with the cradle attachment, and it still worked well.I did not have any trouble with the plug not changing colors.  Mine always changes if the water is too hot.I also love that the tub can be used anywhere.  I use it on a small vanity in the baby's bathroom and have plenty of room.  I would definitely recommed this product.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","A friend passed her tub on to me after I complained about my tub-- the First Years convertible tub/seat which is AWFUL! It's so shallow that there's barely enough water to get the baby's butt wet! this was much better and had two positions -- newborn and infant. Now my 6 month old can sit and splash and not freeze because he's in two inches of water. Wish this had a suction cup on the bottom to keep it from sliding on smooth, wet surfaces.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",Received this as a shower gift and it is great.  It fits on the edges of our kitchen sink (not IN the sink) and the sling was fantastic until my daughter was about 2.5 months (she is long at 24&#34;); kept her from sliding down into the water too much.  Has a drain if you need it (so you don't have to pick up the tub when it's full of water) and has a little spot for soap bottles and a washcloth to keep them handy during bathtime.,4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This tub is so great.  I have been using it since my son's unbilical cord fell off and the design of it is really perfect for bathing young babies.  I never used the hammock feature as I found it was just easier for me to not use it, but it is good for those who would like to use it.Great buy!!!!!!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We got this as a baby gift before the baby was born. We used the sling until he was about 2-3 months old. It was wonderful, the baby never slid around, he was very secure. Then we switched him to the infant side. We had to watch his head because sometimes he would slouch from one side to the other, but that was really only because he was still kind of small. Once he could sit up, we switched him to the toddler side. He is now turning one and still loves the bath tub. All his toys can float in the tub with him, and even at a year old, he still has room to kick and splash. We are going to be moving him to a bath seat, but only because we have another on the way, and want to use the sling for the newborn!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I got this tub as a gift before my son was due; I loved the sling that came with it. The sling makes it so much easier to wash a newborn, I took it off when my son reached 3 months. The tub is pretty easy to clean I just rinse it off after a bath then flip it over and let it dry out in the tub. My son loves playing in the water and I love that I don't have to worry about him slipping because the little 'seat' inside that keeps him in place. The only problem I had was the smaller pad has fallen off. Another feature that great is the built in water basin I can hold his soap, shampoo, and toys in there when not in use. I've had this tub for over 5 months now and no problems so far.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",I had only checked one store and this had such great reviews so I purchased it.  After a trip to target I found it cheaper there.  The tub is great the sling is great and it works very well I would just recommend shopping around if you are cheap like me.,4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I used this tub for my two boys, and I will be using it for the next one.  It is fantastic.  The sling is wonderful for newborns, and the tub is great for when they get older.  The shape prevents the baby from slipping and it is easy to keep clean. I have used many tubs, and this is by far the best one.  What a great deal, too!",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We used this tub for our newborn, until he was old enough start pulling himself up to standing, around 8 months old.  At that point, we ditched the infant tub and put him in the regular tub with some toys.We liked this infant tub because it fit nicely in the big tub OR on top of the kitchen sink.  The newborn sling was only useful for those first few baths, until the umbilical cord fell off.I don't think I'd use this for an older infant or a toddler, as it's easy for them to stand up in it because of the sloped bottom, which puts their feet below the level of their butt, and they could lose their balance or tip over the tub.  (Obviously supervision is always a must during baths.)",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I enjoy using this bathtub for my daughter; the sling was great when she was a newborn and now she fits well in the infant side. I like the area for fresh water, shampoo bottles, or toys. The only detracting feature is the plug, since it leaks. That means the tub has to be very specifically balanced over our large kitchen sink, or it leaks all over the counter. (A surprising lesson to learn. ha) I'd recommend this for parents who have back problems and don't do well leaning over a regular bathtub.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is an excellent tub. The hammock is a life-saver. Our little girl just loves to take a bath in this.

"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This tub has worked great for my son since he was a newborn.  We're still using it 5 months later.  Your baby can grow with this tub.  The way the tub contours with the baby's body is great.  I never felt my baby can slip or be harmed by the tub (of course, I never leave my sight from him when he's in the tub).  I've used another tub while visiting in-laws and didn't like it as much.  So far, this is the best tub for us.",5,1

"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I'm not sure that I saw anywhere on this product mention of the little suction cups that keep it in place.  I wasn't sure that it would be practical or of use, but I definitely like it.  Easy to clean, easy to store. Also, wide enough to fit over the Regalo portable highchair arms that attach to table. Big enough that food smeared and pushed around by little reaching arms  generally doesn't reach the table.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I was thinking there must be a reusable placemat for babies and this is perfect. I ate at a restaurant yesterday with my 10 month old daughter. She fed herself her whole meal and only 2 cheerios and one piece of fruit ended up on the floor. The tray catches most of the food and then she can just eat what has fallen into the tray. It is so great not to leave a huge mess at a restaurant. Now when she starts throwing food on the floor on purpose, that will be another story.The suction cups need to get pretty wet in order to stick, but even when they aren't stuck down the mat doesnt' move much.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","Easy to use, store and clean. Only downfall is it only sticks to smooth surfaces. My Daughter still hasn't been able to un-stick it herself yet, but she's only 15 months old.",4,1
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","This is a very nice product. It collects the child's food, is easy to clean up and rolls up and tucks away very nicely. My only dislike is that it doesn't stick very well on our grooved table. You need a flat surface table for this to work properly.",4,1
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I love this thing.  I've had it for over a year.  We take it with us everywhere we go, so instead of worrying about cleaning off dirty restaurant tables we just put this down instead.  The long cup at the bottom helps to catch spills (not everything alas, but feeding a baby is never super-neat).  I also love how it rolls up nice and tight for easy transport.  And it's easy to clean.  Wouldn't recommend putting it in the dishwasher, however.  It did lose it's shape after a cycle.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",4,1

Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),We took a breastfeeding class and the teacher never mentioned this.  I had the hardest time when my son was born with latching on.  It hurt so much and it would take 45 mins to get him latched on.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I wish I would have known about it before.  Would have saved me 3 days of tears.,5,1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"This was a life saver! Only thing is that I wish I had gotten the regular nipple shield instead of the contact because the cutout prevents it from adhering perfectly. But still, it adheres pretty well and saved me from exhaustion of pumping every time she was hungry (which I did for two and a half weeks before I discovered this) and helped me to transition from a bottle to proper nursing. She is now able to do without the shield but it literally saved us!",4,1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"I don't think that I could have breastfed without this and it is the only reason that I continued breastfeeding.  I never had cracked or bleeding nipples.  I did not have flat or inverted nipples. I ended up buying three (just to have extras on hand because you feed more often than you can wash them).  My baby was born early and stayed in the NICU. The nurses there are adamant about your trying to breastfeed.  I heard so many horror stories.  The nurses gave me this my first day and I never had any trouble.  For the first two weeks, we used this every time he ate.  Then we used it off and on for about three more weeks (5 weeks total).  Then, by that time, we both learned how to do it and he could nurse from my breast without any aid (how to latch, how to cup your breast, etc).  My baby is now 3.5 months old and we exclusively breast feed.  He has never had nipple confusion (though we do give him a pacifier and he eats pumped milk from a bottle - but he nurses every day from the breast as well).  I feel like a dairy & I have never had trouble with supply.  At the three month checkup, my son was in the 87th percentile for weight (and that is compared to normal babies, not preemies).  It is so inexpensive to at least get one to have on hand and give it a shot.",5,1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"I was introduced to this by a lactation consultant with my second baby about a week into breastfeeding. When my milk comes in, it COMES IN! With both my sons I became so engorged that it was difficult for them to latch on. I would have to pump for a few minutes & then have them latch on. The nipple shield helps baby latch on & not get overwhelmed with all the milk coming at them for the first few minutes. Then I take it off when the breast is less taut & put baby back on for the duration of the feeding. It was so helpful with my second baby to help get us through the first month or so. It also helped soothe tough, cracked & bleeding nipples with the initial latch when that was an issue. Once things got regulated I stopped using the sheild. I nursed him for 13 months! Now I'm getting ready for #3 & will have one before baby even arrives.",5,1

When the child is younger, you can use the larger bottles to carry extra water, and when they're older, you can use the smaller bottles to carry food.As for the description -- as of this writing, the description on amazon.com neglects to mention that this is a 6-pack, and the only stock image provided shows 2 discs.  Make sure you're aware of this before you end up with too many discs.  ;)EDIT: A friend just purchased too many, thinking that there were only 2 discs.  I'm going to attach a photo showing 6 discs.",5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discs,I have three Avent bottles but sealing discs didn't come with them.  These are great and serve my needs well to be able to have a bottle that will travel well.,5,1
Baby Magic Calming Milk Gift Set,"I think this item is the perfect shower gift. The lavender-scented wash and shampoo is not overpowering and perfumey-- I think it's just right to make an already sweet-smelling baby smell clean and fresh. The soap is gentle, it has never irritated my baby's skin or eyes. I love the music CD and the soft washcloth that comes in this set. The handy carrier keeps all the bottles upright and together so you can just grab it and set it next to the tub when you're ready for baby bath time. A  new mama can have fun using everthing in this gift bag!",5,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,Comfortable for little onesDid not leakAttaches to regular toiletWe never put batteries in it so didn't have to worry about having a problem using the regular toilet later on.,5,1
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"The Royal Potty has worked great for us.  When looking for a potty I took my son to the store and let him look at all the models.  He liked this one the best.  I have to admit it would not have been my first choice because it had no lid, but he liked it so that's what counts.  He was very excited to use it, and at 21 months has no trouble geting on and off the potty.  The splash guard is not a problem, nor does it pinch his legs, but I think it all depends on the size of the child (my child is tall and thin).As for the music and light.  I started potty training without it because I was afraid it would scare him.  When I put the batteries in he liked the music and it didn't scare him at all, he loves it.  He did try to touch the red light at first, but he has been told that is a ""no touch area"" and it isn't an issue anymore.  The book it comes with is cute too.As for leaks, mine has never leaked.  You have to make sure the bucket part is pushed all the way back and ""clicks"" into place.  I think the people who are complaining of leaks aren't putting the bucket in correctly, or are letting the child do it. As I stated I have a boy and never had leaks.This is a great potty, we be be buying one for downstairs now that our son is potty trained after only three weeks.  I think some of the bad reviews were written by people who tried potty training too early, many said they had 16 month old babies.",5,1
Sassy Baby's First Toys,"I recieved this as a shower gift.  My daughter, now 11 months, has gotten lots of use from all the toys from birth.  There's a good selection of teethers, toys that make noise, and soft toys.  This box provides lots of fun.  Babies of all ages will enjoy the toys and there's enough to rotate so baby doesn't get bored!",5,1
Sassy Baby's First Toys,"Instead of buying these items sperately over time, save yourself the money and buy this box (or add it to your baby shower gift list). I purchased these for my son when he was a few months old, he is now 10 months old and he is still enjoying them. They are bright, attractive and easy to play with. They are small enough to throw a couple into a nappy bag (sorry, diaper bag) without creating bulk. They are really handy for distracting your little one whilst you are on the go (in the car, shopping, etc.)and some are even bath friendly.",4,1
Sassy Baby's First Toys,"I am happy with the total package.  There are a number of things that go with the various stages of our baby's development, and overall I beleive the price works out more economical than purchasing individual toys.",4,1
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,Do you have a jogging stroller with front &amp; back seats rather than side by side?,5,1
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"It took several weeks for us to receive the stroller (that was because UPS damaged the first one they sent), but when we got it we loved it.  We have a 10 week old and a two year old and they both fit in the stroller fine.  The handle bar does not adjust heights, but it is much higher than other handle bars.  I like the shade that the canopy provides.  We have not yet used the rain cover but we are glad it came with it.  Very smooth ride for the children and easy to push while running or walking!",4,1
Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue,"I walk an hour a day using my Double Trouble stroller and my toddler and newborn seem to look forward to the walks as much as I do.  I also have a single jogger by Baby Jogger, but I find myself using my double stroller even when I'm just pushing one.The Tike Tech Double Stroller stands taller than most jogging strollers which is easier to push for those of us who are tall, especially if you're on roller blades.  However, the bar is adjustable for those who don't need the extra height.Another nice feature is the adjustable seat safety bar which I haven't seen on other strollers.  My toddler loves holding onto it.My personal favorite features are the multiple storage compartments and the smooth ride.  This stroller is wonderful for jogging, walking, exercising, and trips to the beach or zoo.  However, as others have said, it isn't ideal for trips to the mall.  If you intend to purchase a stroller for outdoor recreational use, I highly recommend this stroller.",5,1
"Battat Mirror Pound-A-Ball Toy, Colors May Vary","We bought this when our son was 16-months old; he's now 18-months old and loves it, plays with it all the time!  I do have to keep my eyes on the balls because they can get lost easy, but it's worth it to see him using the hammer and watching him play.",5,1
Toysmith Battat Ready Set Go Cars Toy,"I previously bought a set in Australia and my Mother-in-law saw how much fun my daughter and son had with the set that we tracked down two more sets (couldn't get them in OZ any more) through Amazon.com for her other grandchildren.

Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Nursing pillow is great. Haven't used it yet as baby is cozy and taking its sweet time to come out (LOL) but i think its going to be great for the mom and the baby to cuddle up in the pillow,5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,Easy to use and my baby is comfortable. You need to put a cloth or blanket on the pillow for messes since the fabric does not come off for washes.,4,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I purchased this in the Sage pin dot pattern, for a friend as a baby shower gift. She had originally wanted a Boppy, but we were both so pleased when we saw the Leachco Cuddle-U. The issue all us ladies had with the boppy from our own mothering experiences seem to have been solved by the seat strap attachment on the Cuddle-U which keeps the baby from sliding down when reclining on it. One lady at the shower, a mother of two, had used the Leachco pillow with both her babies and said it was the one thing she used daily and couldnt live without. And its good quality, just the right size and firmness (seems a bit softer than the boppy), and the sage color is really pretty. Great product, great price and worth every penny!",5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,I have twins and wanted to get another nursing pillow for my mom to hold one of the babies. I already had the Boppy which I really liked but then saw the good reviews on this pillow and the sale price of $20 which made it an easy choice to try out. I'm glad I bought it!Pros:- Bigger and more plush than the boppy bringing my LO higher up to the breast for a more comfortable feeding (overall comfier in the way it cushions to your body)- Baby seat holder to keep your LO upright and strapped in so no falling over/off the pillowCons:- I would give this pillow 5 stars if it had a removable cover. I'm not sure how well it will wash up since there is none and I couldn't find any replacements online.,4,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This product is perfect! My 2 month old enjoys her alone time propped up on the pillow! It is great to know your little one is secure while you sit next to them, wash the dishes (always in my view), or even get a workout in! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I cannot wait to be able to use this for tummy time!",5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"My baby loved this!!  I received it as a shower gift.  I was planning to use it primarily while breastfeeding.  I did use it for this, but it came more in handy for the baby to sit/sleep in.  He loved it!! It was a GREAT investment.",5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I love this pillow.  I did not try the boppy first, and I don't see why I ever would.  This pillow is perfect for nursing (my baby was a preemie and the pillow was big enough to hold her up) and I love the strap option for when she gets bigger.  I also love the design.  Overall, a great product.",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I wasn't too sure how these bottles worked but I was up for anything having a child who suffered with cholic from 8:30 till well past 1 in the morning every night for 3 months! Within a few days after purchasing these bottles I noticed a great deal of difference in my sons feeding habits - he didn't get as agitated being that the nipple did not collapse and burping wasn't a hassle anymore because he swallowed next to nothing in air. I would say in about a months time, he was doing a lot better with his colic. I honestly think this unique bottle design helped a great deal with that. Highly recommended.",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"These bottles do have extra parts but it only takes a few seconds to put together, and because the bottoms come off they are easy to clean. I know these bottles take a few extra seconds to put together so I don't wait until my child is ready to eat, I have them ready to go before she is screaming for food. They don't leak if you make sure the vent seal is in the bottom of the bottle good, and put together when the bottle/vent is dry. I have had to make sure the nipple is in tight a couple of times or nothing came out. BUT the main fix for not getting milk fast enough is (like many reviews I was about to give up on these bottles) not letting your baby take the nipple to the base of the bottle. If their lips stay around the nipple where it starts to get bigger the milk flows fine...or at least that has fixed the problem for my baby and a friend of mine..and she had never had problems with leaks..we both own about 10 to 15 bottles each. My baby has never got to much air and she is a gulper!! You can see the air bubbles pop because of the vent when ever she takes a break and air/milk goes back in the bottle. I breast feed as well, I switch back and forth since week 4 with no problem. It did take a few times for her to get it. With  Advent she liked the nipple but the flow was way way way to fast even at stage one. So I have stuck with these.As far as not being able to use bottle warmers, microwaves, or steamers. That is the only thing I did not like. Not suppose to use a microwave to begin with because of hot spots. I use my steamer with the bottles and put the nipples and vents in the microwave to boil them faster than in a pan. To warm the milk I put water in a cup, microwave the water for about a min  place the bottle without the nipple in the water for 2 to 3 min and you have a warm bottle just as quick as a warmer and it's not that much more work.Worth a few extra seconds of putting together and warming to keep air out of my baby's belly! Hopes this helps",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I used the old version with my first child, 4 years old, and decided to try again with my newborn.  I love the new version even more and will surely use again is we have another.  The removeable bottoms make cleaning a snap and the design really does cut down on gas.",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,We returned the Avent bottles and bought more Playtex VentAire instead.  Isaiah is 3 mo's old and he has used Stage 2 nipples from birth.  He enjoys drinking from the Playtex VentAire much more than Avent or other brands.  We believe it is because Playtex's venting allows him to suck without encountering increasing resistance and needing to break his seal for the bottle to backfill with air.  The Avent do seem like they would look newer longer but looks aren't everything.,5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I have a 10 month old baby and I have tried EVERY BOTTLE. I used the AVENT with my 1st baby. THESE BOTTLES ARE THE BEST! Why? Because they DO NOT LEAK, NO BUBBLES and the DESIGN is fabulous once the baby holds it her/himself. The angles top is great for LITTLE or NO AIR IN BABY'S TUMMY. The little rubber seal/disk you put in the bottom is a CINCH! Don't wast time or money$$$ on any other bottle!",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"When I registered for my baby shower, I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles (which is what I was wanting), so my review will discuss both types.NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIREFor starters, the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding, because the milk doesn't flow out when the bottle is tipped over.  The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple.Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time.  Approximately 40-45 minutes.  However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily.  So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked.  I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles.  He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well.  He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes.  These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles.REGULAR VENTAIRENow for the regular Ventaire bottles.  I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us.  Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks.  So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn't confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us.The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples.  He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow.  We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth.  I didn't notice him getting choked, and he doesn't have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles.  These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle.Now for the operation of both types of bottles.  They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that.  On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom.  On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it's in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out).We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water.  So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out.  If you don't, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby's hand if s/he can hold the bottle).  This isn't really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of.Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle.  I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles.  My son still burps just as much as the next baby.  Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don't think it makes any difference.",4,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"When my husband and I had our first child (5 mos. ago) we had registered for the Avent bottles.  Little did we know, but soon came to find out, that the formula was just pouring out of our little one's mouth, even using a stage 1 nipple.  We tried Gerber, Dr. Browns, and Evenflo bottles and none of them compare to the VentAire bottles.They cause her no gas at all.  And, the nipples are just right for her.  With the stage 1 nipples, she gets formula only.  However, when the ped recommended thickening her formula, we switched to the stage 2 nipples, and she does great with them.Now, when we have #2, we will be sure to use these bottles.",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"We tried various types of bottles before we started to use this one. My son could not take to the other bottles and the nipples, and when using this one, he sucked in less air (making him less noisy when eating)and he was able to eat comfortably (ie less drool while eating). We like the fact there are two types of nipples as well (stage 1 and 2).  We use the stage 2 when we add cereal and stage one when there is just formula -- hence we do not have to poke holes in the nipple!  It takes a couple of seconds to put together and they are very easy to clean.",5,1
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"Our baby is almost 4 months old, and we love these bottles. I haven't had any problems with the vent bottoms wearing out, and only noticed film on the nipples when they didn't seem to be rinsed well enough after washing. We tried other slow flow nipples, but found that these work the best. Plus the bottles are so easy to clean, I don't have to worry about whether or not there is any build up left in a bottle that has been sitting for a while. I have been sanitizing the nipples and vent bottoms in the Medela Quick Steam Micro Clean bags (you use them in the microwave) and haven't had any problems with either of them.",5,1
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"This item is just beautiful. My daughter has this for her baby. The theme is beautiful. one thing I did notice is that the fabric on the dust ruffle is very thin, so thin you can see right through it. I dont know why they didnt use the same fabric as in the curtain.It seems very easy to rip and tear on the crib. otherwise this set is just perfect.",4,1
Lambs Ivy Jake Diaper Stacker,"I bought this for my baby's nursery, we are not having a full crib set or nursery room hence the fact that you can order the diaper stacker and bumper only in the same design is a big plus, they look great and have a very good quality, can't wait to start using it once my baby is here!!!",5,1
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I bought this carseat almost a year ago for my son when he was 18 months old, I had a fisher price carseat for him which I loved, but the straps no longer tightened, so I didn't feel it was safe any more.  So after a lot of research, and talking to friends, and actually buying one carseat and then returning it, I bought this one, and both myself and my son love it.  Yes the straps bunch up and you have to flatten them out before buckling it, I have never had them twist.  I have never had any problem getting it in a car tight enough with the buckle, and I have had it in a car, a truck, an suv, and my own minivan, and have never had a problem.  Nor have I had a problem with the piece in between his legs EVER coming out, I think that has a lot to do with no putting it in right and making sure it is sitting right, if you take it apart and wash it you must make sure that when you put the latch piece that goes in between there legs back in that you make sure it is lying flat against the bottom of the carseat or it could come out.  I have been so happy with this carseat that I am planning on buying another one in the near future to put into my husbands truck (which my son rides in about 50% of the time that he spends in a vehicle), because my son won't be able to use the one in there for that much longer.  I actually plan on putting the new one in my van and the old one in my husbands truck.  Well I hope this information helps.  I definetely recommend this one.",4,1

I've used these with all 3 of my kiddos.  I could never find a size above a small for my first two kids, but I was glad to find these online in medium and large for my 3rd baby.  I have to say that the size chart should really go by height rather than weight, though.  My son has outgrown his size small but looking at the sizing chart, I suspected he was getting close in weight to the large size range, and having never found them in store, I had no idea how large it would be. So I just bought a large instead of a medium so he wouldn't outgrow that in a month. Well, the large is massive, haha.  My 3-year-old who is around 39"" tall could easily wear this if she wasn't going to get out of bed and have to run to the potty quick or something, lol.

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My daughter has been sleeping in halo wearable blankets since she was a newborn and I have been very happy with both the fleece and cotton versions.

I have had no trouble with the sleeveless versions and they have held up very nicely in the wash. The halo fleece is better quality than the less expensive Carter's sleep sacks. My baby sleeps comfortably in our 68-70 degree home wearing a long sleeve footed sleeper plus a halo fleece wearable blanket. The cotton is a good alternative for warmer nights and/or nap times. The sizing charts seem to be accurate. Our baby is 27"" long and just over 16 pounds.

He's always ending up in the corners of his crib facing different directions, so blankets would get thrown everywhere with him, so it's a big deal to me to not have to worry about him smothering. Also, I have the security of knowing he will stay warm all through the night. He's not gonna lose his covers, so I don't feel the need to go check on him in the middle of the night to make sure he's covered up. Also, it seems to wash out really well. Babies are very messy, but the spit up and baby food seems to wash out just fine in the washing machine! Overall, I think it's a fantastic product. I can't think of a thing I don't like about it. While it is a bit pricey to have to buy a new blanket for your baby as they grow, it's worth it to me considering the warmth and safety the sleepsack provides. Plus, if you have a little baby that needs swaddling, you can get the swaddle version.IF YOU'RE NEEDING A SIZE GUIDE....go to Halo's website. I think it's called Halo Innovations. In their store section at the bottom of a product page you can find a size guide to know what size will be best for your baby.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We bought this for the cold weather months. It works great, and has a cute puppy pattern. bought a size up as our son is super tall, so somewhat long, but nice to have extra space for chubby legs!",5,1
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"The Boppy Pillow was one of the best things I received from my registry.  It really helped my husband when feeding our son, where he could get him positioned just right.  Also, when it was time to learn to sit up, it was a great tool.  Cover was easy to wash!  Definitely worth the money!!",5,1
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,My daughter and I have thoroughly enjoyed the Boppy.  I haven't used it quite as much as I thought I would but I am definitely glad that we have one.,4,1
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"We received this as a shower gift for our son.  I started out breastfeeding, but later, due to medical reasons, had to bottle feed.  It works wonderfully for both!  The baby is very comfortable, and, if you place baby just right, it leaves mom with an empty hand!  Awesome if you are trying to eat at the same time, or just want to read a magazine...just be sure that baby is stable.  : )  We also use this for tummy time.  I can't wait until he is trying to sit up...it will be used for that, too!  I love products that more than one purpose!!!",4,1
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"I had a terrible time trying to get my newborn son to latch on after having a c-sect. My girlfriend came to stay with me for a week and brought this pillow and it was like a miracle. I was comfortable. He was comfortable, and like a DREAM after a few minutes, he was latching on and doing great! Sometimes i need to run out of the room for a minute to grab something out of the oven or whatever and i'll prop Joseph up on our pillow. I did this one day and when i came back, he'd fallen asleep. It is a good idea to hold your baby upright after feeding for at least 30 minutes, so this is a great way to do it without having to hold your baby the whole time. The boppy pillow is one of my favorite things. My husband says it has been a life saver, and it truly has been. At only [$$](this one is [more $$] because of the plush cover) this makes a great shower gift for anyone whether they plan to breast or bottle feed.",5,1
Munchkin Diaper Duck Trash Bag Dispenser with 24 Refill Bags - 1 kit,"when your on the go and you've got a poopy diaper on your hand, you definately want to wrap it. these little duck dispensers are too cute. its cheap and so are the refills. they are soo convient. the little duck gets stained and dirty looking after a while, because of the material its made of. o well though. we have one for each of our diaper bags...it gets the job done and if my son isn't ""in the mood"" to have his diaper changed, this will keep him busy to play with...",4,1

Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"My boy liked the piano when he was too little to stand on his own.  However, he didn't really like to sit it in for more then 10 minutes or so.  Once he was about 8 months old (he's 10 months now) and could stand on his own, we removed the seat so he cound stand/walk on the keyboard and cruise all around the toy, inside, outside whatever.  He loves the thing.  It's a bit large for our den, but our boy really enjoys this thing and it will stay in our den until he no longer likes it.",5,1
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"My daughter is not quite 3 months, but already she's bored with her bouncer and doesn't want to lay in her crib and watch her mobile all day.  So, when I bought the Step N' Play piano, she absolutely loved it!  When her little feet hit those keys and the music and lights start to play she gets sooo excited.  And I'm excited because I can do more things around the house while she's occupied.  All of the brightly colored toys are set perfectly for her little arms to reach, the swivel chair and sliding feature is wonderful (she's already started to turn herself around) , as well as the mirror that she gets a kick out of looking at herself. This entertainer really keeps her attention for quite a while, and I like that the 2 sound settings aren't very loud, so the noise doesn't bother me or her or anyone else in the house. Kudos! to Fisher-Price.  I Love It!  I recommend this toy to all parents who want a safe environment to play and learn to take those first steps.",5,1
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"The only bad part is you have to be careful when taking baby out of the piano seat. My daughter scrapped the top of her foot on the under side of the seat, while being taken out of her piano.",5,1
"Medela Disposable Nursing Bra Pads, 60 Count",I had purchased these 4 years before and had great results and these are of the same quality and absorbency. I do not have large breasts so I didn't have any issues as some of the other mothers with it not holding up. I'm very happy with my purchase.,4,1
Tiny Love Symphony-in-Motion Remote Mobile,"My father purchased this mobile for my daughter when she was 1 month old. She LOVES it! I highly recommend this mobile. Obviously, it is expensive, but not much more than the ones that match bedding, which are generally pastel colors and although very cute, not very captivating. There is great contrast on each animal and there are parts that slide up and down on the bars of the mobile that capture my baby's attention. I can count on her being drawn to this for the 15 minutes it plays. I will be really sad when she can start grabbing it and I have to put the mobile away.However, after a little over 3 months, it stopped working. I had the original receipt, but not the box, so BRU exchanged it for the exact same mobile and kept the box so they could send the broken one back. The second one worked for about 5 minutes and the music sounded really bad, Needless to say, I was very sad and upset because my baby loves it and it was a very costly item that I want to use with future kids. After this trouble, I checked these reviews and realized the problem was not unique.THE GOOD NEWS, I called Tiny Love Customer service (1-888-Tiny-Love) just before Christmas and told them the problem. They said they have had several of the same complaints and they have fixed the motor in the music box. They asked me for a number on the unit and sent me a new music box. I received it just after Christmas, no more than a week after calling them. I was VERY impressed. I read a couple reviews that mentioned that the customer service was really bad, but I did not have that experience. The new one has worked fine so far (1 month later) and the music is nice like the first one purchased. (I also just noticed that you can fill out a form online to get a replacement part.)A couple of negative things.1. The remote is useless. You have to set the remote setting on the music box itself to get the remote to work...what's the point?2. It would be nice if the music and mobile were independent of each other. I have the Kick and Play piano (which she loves) under the mobile so as she gets excited by the mobile, she starts kicking the piano, however, as you can imagine, the music from the mobile overlapping the music from the kick and play piano is quite unnerving :-)UPDATE 9 years later: I just came across this review I wrote. My ""baby"" is now 9 and this thing has been through a few children and STILL works!",4,1
Sunshine Kids Super Mat,We bought these mats because we recently purchased a car with leather seats and have two car seats. The mats cover the seat completely and the pockets for toys come in handy. I am very satisfied with this product. The price was also reasonable for what you receive.,5,1
Sunshine Kids Super Mat,"I purchased this mat back in September to Protect my Black leather seats from my Toddlers Carseat. To date it has protected my seats from indents and damage. It's super easy to install and once it's there you pretty much forget about it until you clean out your car and wash the seats. I would recommend it to anyone with leather seats. I can't comment on if it does stain the seat, mine are black I wouldn't know.",5,1
Koala Baby - Cotton Rib Blanket - Sage,"I registered for this blanket to match our crib bedding for our fist son, and it has been the best and most used blanket.  He has used it every day since birth, through all four seasons, and it has held up wonderfully--it has not torn, faded, balled or lost its softness. It is perfect for swaddling or over the carseat/stroller, and is great use anywhere because it is not too bulky.  A woman once commented that is looked like a handmade heirloom-like blanket because it was so soft and had a beautiful pattern, and she was surprised to hear it was store bought.Now that my son is older, he takes it off of his bed and carries it around.  It has become his favorite blanket!  Since we are using the same crib bedding for our second child, I have registered for this one again in yellow!  I highly recommend this blanket for your little one.",5,1
Tiny Love Double-Sided First Book,My 2 month old baby loves this bumper. She sits in the morning and talks to smily faces and the mirror. Very worth the money.,5,1
Boppy Luxe Slipcover- Blue,I've been using this cover on my boppy pillow for 8 months and with every feeding at home.  It's soft and washes and wears very well.  I even took my boppy with this cover to nurse my baby when I had him in the hospital.,5,1
Colorado Tote,"I have used this bag for the last 15 months with my son.  It has held up so well to all different types of elements (food, milk, dirt, etc.)  It has great storage compartments and helps keep busy parents well organized.  The style and color is versatile enough that mom or dad can get by with carrying it.  I recently downsized to the midi tote because of the great durability.  Highly recommend this bag and the midi tote for quick trips.",5,1
Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer,"My daughter was potty trained at about 20 months old, shes 3 now and this is the best little seat.WE trained her on a standalone at first, terrible. It was a missery to clean and it was gross. It was very small (yet my daughters in the 32nd percentile!) and very annoying. It took up ALOT of space in my LARGE bathrooms, yet the seat was very tiny as I had already mentioned. It leaked and discouraged my daughter, she thought she was ""doing it wrong"". The potty was uncomfortable and was constantly sliding all over the place. I really felt bad for my little baby.So we bought a cheap potty insert, this didnt fit the potty and frightened my little girl when it would wobble and slide. There was really no place to keep it and the soft vinyl seat cover was ripping, UHG.So finnaly we heard about the Bjorn. It deffinatly fit perfectly, with just a twist of the knob it can fit ANY toilet. It isnt in the way anymore because it can be hung on a little hook (my daughter takes great pride in taking it on and off). Its very comfortable but it doesnt have ripping vinyl material, its all one piece of sturdy plastic. I love that its not too cold for my girls tushie in the mornings, and it can retain the heat pretty well (my friend has a potty seat that she has to place a blanket over it so afterwards it wont be too freezing for her daughter to sit on it!) Its definatly easy to clean, just a little baby wipe and its all done, no little creveces to get ""god knows what"" stuck to it, YUCK. The little splash guard can work for boys (My son (6) has tried it, although he was very uncomfortable because of the fact that he stands, but other than that he said it was fine) but its not too annoying for girls, she has never been bothered or hurt by it at all, she actually enjoys holding it! The seat is nice a white, making it easy to spot ""dirt"" and keep it clean, its also nicer than those cheezy charecter ones.This seat is by far the best on the market, I cant complain and I am thinking of purchasing another one for our 2nd bathroom (although they are expensive!)",5,1
Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer,"This has come in so handing with my toddlers who were not ready for the potty chair but that needed serious relief.  With both my sons, it allowed them to sit on the pot without falling in, while being encouraged by a parent to ""let it out"".  Needless to say, constipation creates some very large poops that these kids would never have gotten out otherwise.  Its a must have.",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"This ultrasaucer is the best baby item we own. My husband and I don't know what we would do without it. Our baby boy absolutely loves it. We first started putting him in when he could hold his head up. He was a little small for the seat so we would put blankets in front and behind him so he wouldn't flop around. It was amazing to watch him study each toy then learn how to use it. He has mastered everything on it. It helps build his strength in his legs and back. He loves to spin around in the seat and bounce up and down. Everyone loves watching him play in it. We take it everywhere we go. It is so cute with all of the medieval times themed toys, we call it ""The Royal Playground"". We recommend this to all new parents.",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"This is one of those cases where they've gone overboard with the improvements.  We have twins and borrowed an Ultrasaucer that is about 3 years old.  Our daughters loved it so much that we bought the new Ultrasaucer.  They really enjoy it, especially the the little round musical toy with the horn on top.  However, a few of the ""improvements"" they've made actually take away from the toy.The round drum with the beads that they spin is too small and the beads are way too light - they don't make much noise and are hard to see, so the girls ignore it; the tall mirror is too high; the rocking knight doesn't do much so they ignore that too.A few of the toys that they love on the older model were replaced.  There used to be a frog and a butterfly that rocked when they bounced.  They've been replaced by a plastic cover that lets them see the spring - there is no fun in that.  Also, there used to be a bar that had beads and a butterfly that they could spin which is now gone.Finally, they tout the ability to fold the swing to travel with it, but there are a few problems with this.  1) It is very difficult to fold; 2) folding it only lowers it, the toys stay on and it is still the same width, so you wouldn't bring this anywhere; and most importantly 3) the hooks to secure it in the folded position face outward and are right at the height of a sitting baby's eyes - DO NOT let your child sit right next to it, if they fall on the plastic hooks (and there are three) they could get really hurt.While I wish that they had left some of the toys from the older version, our daughters still love it and I probably would buy it again if given the choice.",4,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"My daughter is now 9 mths old and she loved this toy, she actually bounces herself in it. It does entertain her for a short time but only because she can move around in a circle and bite on the toys. Otherwise, she rather not be in it. The biggest problem with this toy is that the toys do come off. She has discovered that the castle can just be pushed off and she can scratch her self with it. She has scratched her face and arm. She has also hit herself in the face with the mirror. Most of the time I give her toys to play with and she uses it as a chair. It worked for a couple of months but I think once she starts crawling she will not want to be in this toy anymore. It think this toy is also great if you need to do something and be able to watch the baby at the same time without worrying about them falling or crawling all over the place.",4,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"After searching high and low for the perfect activity center I finally bought this for my five month old son. He absolutely loves it!! He loves the bright colors, music, lights and of course all the fun toys. As a matter of fact when we had to leave this morning he got made because he wanted to continue to play!! I thought that it was easy to put together all you have to do is follow the instructions. I am glad that i spend the extra $ on this activity center because it is well worth it!",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"I worried that Ethan might be bored being on his back so much, and he hasn't really decided to crawl yet, but he likes sitting up and can stand (with balance assistance) a little.  so many positive reviews of the exersaucers led me to buy one.I can't say that he universally loves it, but each time I put him in it he spends more time futzing with all of the toys and getting the hang of the spinning seat.  i've already had to raise the toy platform a notch, and he's only just six months this week.  i think he definitely likes the noisy bits... well, i'm sure he likes the noisy bits because when he finds one, he focuses on it.he also likes to taste everything, and the mirror is currently his favorite flavor.  he's partial to the pennant, but apparently the frog isn't too tasty.  (yes, it's a frog.  i asked evenflo, and despite my suggestion that it's a dragon, they've insisted it's no more fantastic than a mere amphibian.  albeit with a crown.  and front flippers.  yeah, i know, it's clearly a dragon.  but go figure.  and i lost a bet with my wife, and had to clean the bathroom as a result of losing.  so thanks evenflo, thanks for putting a frog in there.)my boy ethan is also a strong little man, so i don't know how long some of the toys will last, at least connected to the platform.  he's liable to start pulling some of them free soon.  i'm resigned to that, as i think the toy platform is slightly too crowded as it is.  the natural process of using the toy will clearly fix that.i'll tell you this: it was a snap to install, and the design impressed me.  it has some logical design elements I like: the seat basket snaps it easy but securely, the legs are strong, the base solid.would i recommend an Exersaucer?  yes, i would.  However, i might not recommend the ultra, perhaps because of the toy clutter.  the next level down might have enough toys evenly-spaced out for your child.Fred",4,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"I did extensive research before I bought an exersaucer, and I couldn't be happier with my decision to go ahead and buy this model, despite some initial concerns. I wasn't originally going to buy an exersaucer at all, due to studies suggesting that these mechanisms slow down the time it takes a baby to learn to walk. Then I decided I didn't care what studies had shown---my baby needed some entertaining, had mostly gotten bored with lying on his back on his activity mat, and I simply couldn't spend every second of every day entertaining him!I am primarily writing this review to dispel concerns others have had about this model, and to praise Evenflo for their excellent customer service.First, I want to address the time it takes to put this toy together. It took me half an hour from start to finish, which seems to be how long it has been taking most people. To some, this might seem like a long time, but I really wasn't bothered by it. Plus, the instructions are VERY straight-forward, so I don't really see how, if following the instructions, anyone would have actual trouble putting it together.Second, the first thing I did after putting the ultrasaucer together was call Evenflo's customer service to find out if there were other toys I could get to replace the joker and mirror (after reading so many negative comments about these toys, I didn't want to take any chances, even though the joker was the ""newer"" version with the rounded top). The representative I spoke with was very helpful and offered to send me toys from a different model to replace them. Plus, the castle piece that came with my ultrasaucer popped out much too easily, so I asked to have that replaced, too. No problem--the only thing I had to agree to do was send the parts I didn't want back to them in a prepaid envelope, which was fine with me. Though I was told it might take up to two weeks to receive the replacement toys, it actually took less than 5 days. In sum, great customer service, with no questions asked!Moving on to how my son feels about his exersaucer.....he LOVES it! He is almost seven months old now (we bought the ultrasaucer when he was six months old, which I personally think is an appropriate age to start using this), and greatly enjoys spending time in his ultrasaucer. Though I try to avoid leaving him in it for too long, he would probably be content to stay there for close to an hour if I let him. Surprisingly, the only toy he doesn't care for is the soft frog, which isn't a big deal, since I can take the frog off of the ""rod"" it is attached to and put a different toy on the rod. He loves all of the other toys, and I think his favorite is actually the knight that rocks back and forth (my least favorite...go figure). His second favorite toy is the soft flag, which he LOVES to suck on. The most fun he has though, comes from being able to jump up and down, which he does...a lot!I have not had any problems with this toy since purchasing it, and my son has never been hurt using it. Also, I find the collapsible feature very convenient for taking the ultrasaucer on trips. I don't think it's hard at all to collapse, unlike some other reviewers. It takes about 30 seconds to do.All in all, I think this was $80 well spent, particularly since I can use this for future children.",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"We love this item! It kept our son happy and entertained for quite some time and he used it everyday until recently.  He is now 11 months old and is too busy cruising around the house to be confined, however he still goes by it and plays with the toys without being in the middle. The seat in the middle rotated easily and he loved to play with all of the different types of toys. We have had no problems at all and highly recommend it.  It really makes life easier...we will miss it when we put it away :)",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,This is a wonderful toy.  We purchased this toy for our son when he was 4 mos.  After we got it put together and adjusted to his height we put him in it and he just went to town jumping up and down.  He loves this toy.  The toys that located all around the top will keep your little ones attention for a long while and it will strengthen their legs at the same time.  Our son is now 6 mos and still loves to get it in and jump around and play.,5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"Our little girl is 4 months old and has just started playing in her exersaucer. She has loved it from the beginning. She loves to pull the toys to her so she can chew on them. She is learning that the seat spins, and it is so much fun to watch her in it. She happily plays for at least 30 mins at a time",5,1
Boppy - Tummy Play,"If your baby hated tummy play as much as mine did, this toy is for you.  We couldn't get our 3 month old son to stay on his tummy for more than 2 minutes without screaming.  We tried the big Boppy and he kept scooting down because it was too big. I bought this Boppy hoping he would learn to enjoy tummy play on a more soft surface- HE DID!!  He loves his boppy and now spends an hour a day on his tummy, half on his Boppy reaching for the toys, the other half on a mat.  Every day we see more progress - wish I had bought it sooner.  Moms to be - I highly recommend this!! Put it on your registry and get your baby to enjoy tummy play early on.",5,1
Koala Baby Chambray Hamper - Light Blue,"We purchased this hamper for our daughters nursery and I'm very pleased with it.  It did not require any assembly and it does not take up a lot of space.  I like the mesh laundry bag that goes inside, it just makes toting all the dirty clothes to the washer that much easier.",5,1
Malawi - 6 Piece Bedding Set.,"I looked everywhere for a crib set that I really liked and would be neutral for both a boy or girl, since we don't know what are having.  The colors are great for both sexes and so is the pattern.  I was a little uneasy paying so much for a crib set, but the quality is excellent and my husband loves it too.",5,1
Malawi - 6 Piece Bedding Set.,"This was by far, my favorite bedding set that Babies R us carried. I received it for my baby shower, and we went right home and set it up. It looks absolutely adorable. The sheets washed nicely, and the bumpers are a nice thick quality. I couldn't be more pleased with the set. It is great for a boy or a girl, and because the set is so colorful, any color sheet matches great. Very pleased.",5,1
Malawi - 6 Piece Bedding Set.,"My husband and I love this set. We don't know if we are having a boy or a girl, so we wanted something for either and that could grow with our child. The actual colors and fabrics are much prettier than on the website. We painted the walls a medium blue and two dressers, one yellow and one green to match. We purchased animal knobs at a home improvement center for the dressers. I washed the bumpers with Dreft on delicate cycle and hung to dry, they came out beautifully, it held its shape and there were no rips. I washed and dried the sheet on delicate and had no fading and very few wrinkles. I haven't washed any of the other items yet because they won't be touching the baby. (We are hanging the quilt on the wall for now.) We purchased or registered for many of the coordinating accessories, but we like that we can add almost anything animal theme to the room and it fits in nicely. Everyone tells us how gorgeous the room is and we can't wait for the baby to arrive in a couple of weeks to see how he or she likes it.",5,1
Disney Pooh - Mobile,"My daughter LOVED this mobile.  My only wish was that it played continuously, because I had to rewind it every three minutes!",4,1
Disney Pooh - Mobile,"I received this mobile as a shower gift and it has been great!  My son is now 10 months old and we still use it to settle him down.  The bright colors and even the little mirror on the bumble bee are great attention grabbers!  It would be nice if it ran consistently (without a windup), but it's still definately worth it.  Even to this day my son loves to ""talk"" to Pooh!",4,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Deluxe Auto Mirror,Tried others.  Worked for my first and now working like a charm for my 2nd.  This one keeps my little one's interest the most.  The remote control is one of my favorite features.,5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Deluxe Auto Mirror,I like the size of the mirror......bigger than most.The lights can't be seen during the day and the remote only works if you can position it just right (not possible while I'm driving).  The music seems to sooth my 2 month old.,4,1
Chicco Hippo Hookon High Chair - Nature,"Ok...no I've never been inclined to write a baby product review until now but this story needs to be told and goes like this.When our baby was approaching the sitting up stage, my wife asked me do some research and pick out a hi-chair. I went on consumer reports, I went into many baby sites and I finally chose the Hippo hook-on. It just seemed so practical and since neither my wife or I have any aversion to returning a poorly performing product I felt we had nothing to lose.So we get to the store and my wife quickly decides a standing chair with cute sounds and colorful images was a better choice at $80.00 and my review and research time went hurriedly out the window.Because she never even looked at the Chicco product and went straight to the traditional chairs I quickly became annoyed and frustrated and expressed those feelings freely at every opportunity I had.We got home, I assembled the chair as any well-trained husband would and you might think the story was over there. Then again I would be writing about THAT chair instead of this one wouldn't I? In fact I wouldn't be writing at all...I digress.Being the intuitive and loving wife that she is, she went out a few days later and got the Hippo hook-on...TOO. She actually bought both and SHE agreed they could both find use in our happy home. I figured I had won a moral victory in the least, pushing out of my mind that we now had $130.00 worth of feeding chairs that no less than half of which was unneccessary. I shredded the divorce papers and we went on feeding our baby.I lowered and secured our little girl into her standing chair and she fussed every time, equating it I guess to every other restraint equipped device we hook her into. But the hook-on chair was different...she was at the same table, at the same level as the rest of us and she was smiling and playing. And that was one of those unexpected intangibles that don't get onto the labeling or specification lists of baby products.And you may think the story was over there but it wasn't...we took our hook-on chair to restaurants, to friend's and families' homes and I would be lying if I told you it fit on ALL tables because it didn't. But it has only NOT fit (in 3 months time) on two tables that we've attempted, and that's pretty good odds.As the story ends, my fair and lovely wife watched the hi-chair she bought get tripped over, pushed aside unused, and ultimately collect dust as so many primary colored baby items do over time.In the end, she saw $80.00 sitting there and quietly returned her chair.Now I have nothing against traditional standing chairs and perhaps if this chair hadn't been invented we would be just silly listening to the cutesy sea-themed jingles over and over again. But...this thing rocks and our little girl of 10 months now just loves it!Pros: read moral victory above. cleans easy, travels easy, still looks new, super sturdy, takes up no extra floor spaceCons: still looking, truly no complaints",5,1
2-in-1 Car Seat Cover `n Carry,"While flying w/ my 21 month old son, the Car Seat Cover N' Carry was a life-saver.  With luggage, stroller and toddler in tow, this product saved me the additional headache of worrying about the car seat.  I used it primarily in the back pack position, which freed my hands to keep up w/ everything else. It's also nice because it folds up quite small and can be placed in carry-on luggage, or just underneath the seat (also easy to store at home/car).  I did not have any problems w/ the bottom ripping or fraying like other reviews have said (maybe because I didn't roll it).Word to the wise: When walking down the aisle of the plane, PICK UP the car seat and carry it, you can't wheel it or carry on your back...those darn aisles just aren't wide enough ;)",4,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,My daughter loved this toy. This toy was my daughter's favorite toy between the ages of 3-6 months (now she loves the Jumparoo). At first she just laid under it and stared at the lights and listened to the music until she was able to reach and grab. This replaced her Gymini which she never really cared for. She loves to kick the keys with her feet as well. She gets so excited when she plays with it that she kicks it away from her. The only negative I can say is that I wish it had rubber feet so it wouldn't scoot away on the floor when she gets excited. I end up putting the legs in my shoes on the floor so it stays put.,4,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,I think this is one of the best infant toys you could have.  It is a must for any family with an infant or a toddler. It keeps them entertained for hours and will not get on your nerves.  the quality of the product is excellent. It will last for years to come. A definite must have.,5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"I have a two month old son and I lay him down on a blanket and put the toy over the top of him. He kicks the toys with his feet and giggles at the toy. I have never seen him enjoy any of his toys as much as this one, and if you need to get a few things done around the house, this will keep your baby occupied for a while so you can get things done. It is well worth the money.",5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"I absolutely love this toy! We bought it for our daughter when she was almost three months old. She loved to lay underneath it an kick at it. She is now 10 months and we have it in the standing position she is still interested in the piano and plays with it often.The great thing about this gym is it changes from each position very easily!If you are looking for a gym for your youngster that will grow with them, I highly recommend this!!!!",5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,I love love love this toy!!! My daughter had used it from the day she was born. Now she uses it to pull up and stand. She has never once tipped over when trying. This is one of the few toys that she can stand and play with since that is big in the house now. This toy has gotten more use than any other.,5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,It is a great toy. It grows with the child. My son still plays with his and he is 18 months now. And I am buying one for our new cousin!!,5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"My baby is only 13 weeks and loves this toy.  He is fascinated by the lights and music.  It will actually run for 10 minutes, which is longer then a lot of other toys on the market.  It is easy to change from one position to the next.Right now I put him in his bouncy chair and the toy in position two and slide it over his legs so he can look at it.",5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,My daughter got this as a Christmas gift when she was 2 months old and began using it immediately in the laying down position.  She learned how to kick up her legs with it as well as to follow the lights...GREAT STIMULATION!,5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"We have the Sparkling Symphony Gym at home, and just got this gym at my baby's grandparents' house.  I like this better because you can convert it for a baby to play lying down, sitting or standing, while the SSG works only lying down or standing (not sitting).  My 7-mo-old is at the sitting stage so this is perfect for her, and will last quite a long time as she can use it while standing.  The music is quite nice -- something you won't get sick of when listening to it over and over.  It's very easy to put together.  My baby seems to love it -- she whacks at the keys, smiles really big, and bounces her whole body up and down as she plays the piano.",5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,My son got this again from my niece and he loved it fromthe get-go. he was a month old when we got it and he has been playing with it ever since. He would cry until we put him uder the singing stars. He would watch in amazement. He is now 6 months old and sitting and we converted it to Stage 2 and he loves it in a whole new way! It is a super durable toy with a nice variety in music. It is simple for him to use and entertaining. It's a great price for all teh use you will get out of this item!,5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"This is my son's favorite toy.  I registered for it on a whim, but it has ended up being the best thing we have.  He loves to lay under it and play with the hanging toys.  He grabs them and kicks them.  He also sits up and plays the piano.  It has volume control and doesn't play irritating music.  This is a great toy for young babies!",5,1
The First Years Simple &amp; Secure Stair Gate,"We were very pleased with this gate. It is blocking the stairway that leads from our living room into the basement. The gate was functional, sturdy, easy enough to open for adults and can be easily removed when it is not needed (for example, when we host dinner parties, we like to take it off so our guests can go downstairs without trying to figure out the lock). I also liked the fact that the lock was plastic and smooth, so our son did hurt himself if he accidentally ran into the gate since the lock appears to be right at forehead level of a one-year-old.However, after about 14 months of very frequent use, the lock broke, as many reviewers have said. I feel like we got a pretty good use out of it, but it is a bummer to have to replace it now, especially since we will only need it for another 6 months or so. Almost wish it broke a few months earlier so that it would still be under warranty.",4,1
The First Years Swing Tray - Portable Booster Seat Blue &amp; Aqua,"We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly!We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all.Anyway, I highly recommend it...",5,1
Rest Assured,Our newborn likes rolling onto his side when he's sleeping and this has been awesome.  He doesn't mind it being there but it keeps him still.  It's also washable for accidents and when he spits up a little bit.,5,1
Inclined to Sleep,"We love this and now we give it to all our friends that are having babies.  Our daughter hated sleeping on her back and after we got this and she could sleep on her side, she started sleeping through the night at 4 weeks old!  The incline helped her digest better and I would recommend it to anyone!",5,1
Inclined to Sleep,"I bought two of these in anticipation of the birth of our twin girls.  I thought we might use them for sleeping in their shared crib.  However, we ended up putting one of the larger crib-width foam wedges in the crib, and are instead using these &quot;Inclined to Sleep&quot; wedges for nighttime bottle feedings.  I know there aren't many folks out there who need to feed two newborn babies bottles at the same time, but if you happen to be one of them, I'd highly recommend this product.  It keeps the girls in place, with their heads slightly elevated while drinking.  I've set them up on a twin matress on the floor of the nursery, and I drape a baby blanket on top of each wedge before putting a baby on it (to catch the inevitable spit up or bottle spills).  This system works wonderfully for me, and in fact, I'm thinking about buying another pair for the living room to set up a second &quot;feeding station&quot; there for daytime feedings.",4,1
Inclined to Sleep,My son slept in my bed for the first 4 months on the inclined to sleep positioner. I think this made the transition into his crib(also on the inclined to sleep positioner)smooth. I would lay his blanket across him & tuck it under the positioner to make sure it stayed in place. My son is now 6 months old & rolling everywhere & that is the only reason we had to stop using it. It worked really well for us!,5,1
Munchkin Deluxe Bottle  And Food Warmer With Pacifier Cleaning Basket,"I really liked this warmer. I was given one when my first daughter was born. As some of the reviews state, it may take a little practise to get used to how much water to put in, but that doesn't take much to master. The only recommendation that I have is that if you use the Dr. Brown's bottles with the tubes in them, take the tubes out before putting the bottle in the warmer, or you'll end up with the milk leaking into the warmer.",4,1
Graco - Duo Stroller Rain Cover,"This double rain cover is a life saver for us.  It is durable and lightweight, fits our GRACO TANDEM STROLLER like a glove, and has lasted through the winds of March into the rains of April without so much as a leak.  The side ventilation holes offer our kids a chance to breathe a little fresh air, the snaps secure the cover to the sides of the stroller snugly, and the whole things pops on and off in a matter of seconds.  Just roll it up when you're through and toss it in the stroller basket or back of your car.  The price is right and you won't have to replace it after a few rain storms like other cheaply made versions.  A great product for a great price!",5,1
Evenflo Comfort Select Auto-Cycling Breast Pump,"I used this model for my daughter 4 years ago and again for my son, and had no problems either time.  It has worked great for me!  I use this pump very frequently and have never had any problems with suction.  A few things that I especially like about this pump: how compact it is, that it runs on batteries or with an AC adaptor, and how easy it is to clean.  I have and will continue to recommend this pump to anyone who asks.",5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",A little pricey but works great. We purchased the car seat that came with a base and an additional base for our other vehicle. We then purchased this one for the sitter. It is easy to install works great in all types of vehicles. For our situation I just wish it wasn't so expensive. For one it's not so bad but since we have now purchased 3....obviously we like the product though. =),4,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","I have to say that I want to thank Graco for thinking of the parents!!!This is probably the most innovative invention that anyone could have made.  I love the fact that we don't have to move the base from car to car every time we change cars.  This also saves us from having to buy a second seat for convenience.Also, I love that I can just unlatch the carseat from the base and carry her inside in the seat.  It keeps the seat from getting cold in the winter time since you can take it inside with you!Everyone should have one!!!",5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",we had to get a new one only because my FIL accidentally picked ours up for  yard sale and sold it.  We loved our other one so much we just replaced it with another one,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","I found the best price for these is here on Amazon. The base fit into my Dodge Ram back middle seat perfectly and the LATCH system keeps it very secure. However, my wife's car does not have LATCH and we were required to use the seat belt. Her car has leather seats and the front of the base slides side to side on the leather no matter how tight the seat belt is, the sliding does not happen in the Dodge Ram.",4,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","Very Pleased with this purchase, great price but expensive shipping. The exact base we where looking for for the newest car seat purchase",4,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",This item was just as I ordered and just exactly as the one originally purchased with my travel system. I like it because it is so convenient in moving my little one from one vehicle to the next and even to the stoller!,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",i love having an extra base for my husbands truck. makes life much easier not having to switch bases or buckle the seat in every time. product was shipped fast and i had no problems at all.,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",We needed an extra base for our infant carseat. Looked up the model of the seat and the base works perfect.,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",The infant car seat base came as listed and worked with me car seat. it came in a timely manner.,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","It's really convenient to have an extra car seat base. In addition to having the base in the second car, we've used the extra base on airline travels and extended grandparent visits. It also helped us to delay the cost of a second car seat for a year -- I would carry my child and the bucket seat into the day care and my husband would pick them up.",5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",It's just a plain old second base so my husband and I can each have one in our car.  What else can I say?  It does what it's supposed to do and that's all I want from it.  We love Graco products!,5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","This worked great for our snugride Infant car seat, Platinum, easy to install. Tip: we have a Audi Q5 and had to use a towel under the base due to it slipping. Once we put that under it, it worked just fine. We also loved the platinum car seat, baby was really comfy in it. Both worked great together.",5,1
"Burlington Baby Large White Willow Basket Set with Liner, Pink",They fit everything I need them to in my nursery- and look adorable on my changing table!,5,1
"Burlington Baby Large White Willow Basket Set with Liner, Pink",These are really cute.  They are very big. Too big that they wouldn't fit on the shelves I wanted them on.  I had to return them. If you have a deep wide spot to put them you will love them. I found this smaller & love it.,4,1
Pooh Bundles Tote,"When I didn't get this item for my shower, I decided to take a chance and order it online without seeing it first.  I have to say that it is a really great bag.  Lots of storage space for baby stuff and Mommy stuff.  Stores easily over the stroller handlebar and isn't too bulky.  Design isn't too feminine or masculine so Daddy isn't embarrassed carrying his daughters bag around town.",5,1
Pooh Bundles Tote,"Really cute diaper bag, lots of capartments and space.  I would recommend this it anyone that wants a spacious diaper bag and one that is comfortable.",5,1
Swing Tray Portable Booster - Primary,"My son got this chair for his 1st birthday.  I  wish we'd had it from the start.We've been using it for over 3 months now and I haven't got a single complaint.It's ridiculously easy to clean and there's nowhere for food to hide.I haven't had any problems with stability and sturdiness.My son is pretty mellow and tends to sit calmly during meals howeverso I can't say how it would hold up to roughness.That said, I highly recommend it.",5,1
Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"I am thinking maybe the monitor has been improved over the ones that are just a year or 2 old. We love that we can hear the baby breathe with out the volume on max. The vibrate works great when the dishwasher is running or I am doing another chore that is noisy. We live in a close neighborhood with apartments very close by and nothing has interfered with the monitor. This unit does not have the recharable batteries but the hearing portion does come with an adapter that could be plugged in. Really being able to plug the unit in, I have only changed the batteries once in 6 months. I like this unit and would purchase it again.",5,1
Mother's Touch Deluxe Baby Bather,"if your plan is to bathe your child in the sink this product is great!! particularly if you plan touse one of those removable faucet hoses, its like a shower.  My son loves it, even though he does slide down in it.  i highly recommend, but not so sure its a good bather for the tub - the larger version of this is.",4,1
Mother's Touch Deluxe Baby Bather,"I've started using it with my newborn and found it very easy to ""shower"" him by simply pouring water over him. Because it doesn't fit in my sink, I use it in the bath tub. This seat eliminates the whole ""sitting in unclean water"" thing. Plus the fact that it folds compactly is great. It can be used at home or when you are away. It fits neatly in any suitcase and dries quickly.",5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany",I cant wait to get my pictures printed and use this frame! Great memory keepsake! I think it would be good as a gift to someone else too!,5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany",We have one of these for both of our sons.  Its a terrific keepsake and very easy to assemble.,4,1

Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat / Infant Carrier with LATCH Base - Black Sable,"I have read several of the reviews and the negative reviews talk about the amount of money spent versus the amount of time a child is in the seat.  I have one thing to say about this...money should not be an issue when you are purchasing a safe ride for your child.  The seat is expensive but in my opinion it is well worth the money spent.  I purchased this seat for my son two years ago and I am now using the same seat for my daughter.  I was tempted to get a new seat for my daughter (something more feminine) so I checked out the Graco Snugride....it didn't fit into my back seat very well and therefore moved around a lot.  The Peg Perego seat is much easier to secure into my vehicle than the Graco seat.  Both of my children are so snug when they are properly fastened into the seat that I don't worry about their safety.  I hope I never have to find out first hand of course but I have great confidence in this seat.  Aside from the safety, I also have noticed that both children seem to be very comfortable in the seat.  They sleep well in the seat even on long trips.Once your child outgrows the Peg Perego seat I highly recommend the Britax Roundabout or Marathon car seat (depending on the size of your vehicle would determine which one to purchase).  The roundabout works for children 5 to 40 lbs. and the Marathon is designed for 5 to about 65 lbs.  They are both great seats but the Marathon is rather large.  Either seat is a great investment in your child's safety.Last tidbit...never be afraid to go to the store and ask to try different car seats in your vehicle.  Even if Consumer Reports determines that a car seat is the best on the market, remember that every back seat is different and that same seat may not fit in your car.  At Babies R Us, an associate will accompany you to your car with different seats and allow you to try them before you purchase.  Not every seat is designed to be the safest in your car so you have to check and see how each seat fits into your car.  The tighter you can get the base seat belted into your car the safer it will be in the unfortunate event of an accident.",4,1
Koala Baby 6 Piece Crib Set - Locomotion,This set looks great in my baby boys first room.But I must comment that the craftmanship of the stiching is poor.After I washed the quilt I had to sew back on half of the patches.I just hope that the valance and dust ruffle don't do the same.Other than that I think that this set will be able to grow with my son through the years.,4,1
Koala Baby 6 Piece Crib Set - Locomotion,"I love everything about this bedding set. There are so many colors and designs in the fabric that it is so easy to find things to match it from wall color to different styles of curtains, little accent pictures, knobs for the dresser and other stuff to decorate my son's room. This is by far my favorite bedding set!",5,1
Koala Baby 6 Piece Crib Set - Locomotion,"I just received this bedding set for my pending baby boy.  It is absolutely beautiful!  The workmanship is wonderful.  The color and details are more than I had expected from the pictures I had seen.  I put it on my gift registry without ever seeing it in person, and trust me, it has exceeded every expectation!A wonderful product and value for all that you get in the set!",5,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black",This works great - protects seat from the snow dripping off the kids' shoes just like I wanted all while protecting my seat from indentations,5,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","We bought this before our first since we had leather seats in the car at the time. We wanted to protect the leather from getting permanant dent marks from the car seats.  This thing catches everything!!! We even had a few barfing accidents when he was almost a year old when the car seat didnt catch the mess, the seat protector did which in turn saved us from cleaning formula and gung from in between the back seats!  This is also great for those runaway cracker crumbs and cheerios!  We now have a different car without leather seats but we still using it to keep the seats a little neater from spills!  Great product!By the way, when we sold the car with the leather interior, you never would have known there was a baby car seat back there!",5,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","I ordered these to protect the leather in my new Ford Flex, after returing a black Eddie Bauer set with no back piece to Target.  The gray looks so much better than all the other options I considered.  They worked great for both my rear-facing and front-facing car seats on the second row bucket seats.  Both car seats fit very tight and secure... no slippage or wiggle room.  You're supposed to use only the bottom piece for the rear-facing, but I used the whole set anyway.  I will mention, however, the front-facing car seat was still a bit too tall for the seat saver.  I had to add a gray, folded over hand towel to protect the headrest from the top of the car seat.  I don't think there's anything the manufacturers could do to solve this problem though.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","I had to buy a new car when I got pregnant. It had brand new tan leather so I bought this to protect the seats. They first of all, work great at the protecting...however, they blend in so well they are hardly noticeable. Works so good I bought another one for my second baby's car seat.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","Great item, color looks great on my new 2013 Town and Country in grey.  They have to be situated just right to buckle in when using a booster,  as they get bumped and moved as kids get in and out so need to be adjusted often.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","Nice light color, goes well with the interior of our car.  While it doesn't completely keep seats from being crushed by the carseat, it does help the cushions somewhat.  Also, food is no longer ground into the seat and the seatsaver wipes off nicely.Con:  Would be nice if the back was higher for the humongous carseats they make now (Graco Nautilus).",4,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black",What a great product! It goes in very easy. Catches 99% of the mess my kids drop or spill (impossible to catch it all) as well as protecting the leather. I ordered 2 and use for both a front and rear facing car seat. I,5,1
Mid City Tote - Diaper Bag,"I just bought this bag and being particularly picky about my bags, I pretty much like this one. For the moms (or dads) who don't like the baby-themed bags, this is great. Looks like real leather, the white stitching looks nice, not cheap. The bag is roomy on the inside, which was one of my main concerns. I have a toddler and a baby and need enough room for diapers, wipes, clothes for both toys, etc. and this bag can fit it all. The straps are long enough to get all the way up on your shoulder without falling down. The only thing I do NOT like about it is the zipper does not close the bag entirely. There is a one inch or so opening on either side of the zipper, so potentially a small item could fall out if the bag got flipped upside down. Otherwise I would have given it a 5/5.",4,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"We have used this for our son for several years, and we really love it - there a dual sounds that can be combined and it works very well.  We have taken this on trips to hotels also.",5,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,I bought this sound machine for my grandson.  He is 2 yrs. old and has always needed background noise to sleep.  He loves the rain and the fact that he can push the buttons.  I consider it a great buy!,5,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"Sounds a little tinny, buttons either a little touchy or I'm heavy handed. Still good for the price",4,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I am very pleased with this product.  My 4-month old has only been taking 20 minute cat-naps and I needed some way to encourage longer sleep during the day.  I thought maybe a background noise would help.  I did a TON of research and review-reading before making this purchase.  I was concerned after reading the reviews about the lack of volume that has been claimed for this product, but have not found this to be an issue at all.  The volume levels are not too soft at all.  In fact, I often worry about it being too loud.  It has a great volume control to fit your needs.  We use the ocean sound, and at first I was worried because one wave sound is louder than the rest, but turning the volume down one notch solved this so it wasn't overbearing.The sounds are fantastic.  My husband likes to play with the blending of various sounds.  There is no break in the repeat of the noises and you cannot tell when the sound is starting its cycle over again, as I have read on so many other sound sleepers.  There is a HUGE variety of sounds as well.  I was impressed.  It has something that should match anyone's needs.It's a huge advantage to have the sound sleeper be battery operated or able to plug into a wall.  It's been a piece of cake to quickly unplug and use it on battery power when my son has fallen asleep in our bedroom or another location.  I love this feature.  We live overseas with the military, and when we vacation we can still take it with us to use on the batteries, since we can't use the plugs here without an adapter/transformer.We love the timer that is on the sound sleeper as well.  We usually let it run on ""on"" until my husband and I go to bed.  Then, when I am going into my son's room to check on him for the last time in the evening, I simply flip the button to timer and an hour later it goes off when we're all asleep.  Love the timer feature.Overall, I'd give this product more than 5 stars if the ratings were higher.  It was a fantastic purchase for very little spent.",5,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I ordered this for my husband, he was having a hard time sleeping.  The first few nights it was great but after awhile you can tell when the sound loops.  If you pick up on that sort of thing, don't order this.  But if you don't care about the repetition it's a great product for the price!",4,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"We used these with both our kids - one is 5 and still uses this daily.  We could not live without it.  I bring one whenever we visit my parents house, where it is loud at bedtime - both the kids' bedtimes, and ours.  I find that its the only thing that drowns out the sounds of my parents doing dishes and speaking loudly (especially if my elderly dad doesn't have his hearing aid in!!) and allows ME (much less the kids) to fall asleep easily.  It also helps my daughter if we are awake earlier than her - it helps her get the sleep she needs.  I disagree with folks who say it doesn't get loud enough - I simply strategically place the machine either close to the door or the bed (or both) so it is loud enough.  We hear it from her room to ours at night too.  Again, my machines are both at least 5 years old, and have traveled cross country many times.  The one that is used daily still is just now getting a little iffy function-wise, and its not the machine, its the cord that is 'sensitive'.  I'm buying one for my sister-in-law, who is expecting her first, right now!!  I highly recommend!!!!",5,1
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I purchased this item for my newborn who will be born soon.I decided to try it out since i have personally been having a hard time falling asleep 38 weeks pregnant and all.So I have been using it for a week now.I must say I have been sleeping like a baby ,hee hee I guess thats exactly what I needed it for in the first place so it works great.I usually have to wear ear plugs to block out outside noise that keep me awake all night.When i go to sleep with this nifty machine on I dont need the ear plugs.It just sort of blocks out all the other stuff.It lets you select one sound,you can mix sounds and also put the system on timer (it will shut down after a while,next time you wake up its off).You can either turn it back on or just leave it off.I love it,i hope the baby sleeps as good as I have been :).I would recommend to friends.I was going to get the little fury lamb that makes the sounds but got this instead because it can be plugged into the wall.Can use the extra savings on batteries although you can put batteries in this unit and use unplugged.I hipe someone will give us the little lamby plush toy sound maker but if not I will be happy with this unit because it lets you put batteries for travel.Great for moms,dads, and babies",5,1

DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I really like this product, my only complaint is I wish it was louder. Other then that I use it on my 12 week old son, who LOVES the sound of white noise. This machine doesn't actually play ""white noise"" but he uses it on the ""wind"" setting. He sleeps better then ever! For 20 bucks its the best around! If you have the money though, use this White Noise Machine Sleep Mate Sound Screen Dual Speed Sound Conditioner Marpac 980-A Latest Modelits better!!",4,1
Playtex Premium Nurser Newborn Gift Set,These are the best nipples yet and satisfied my strictly breastmilk daughter for one year while I worked.  I tried avent and was very dissatisfied at how stiff the silicone is and the shape was not nearly as close to breast as playtex.,5,1

In 1983 when I had my son I used the playtex nurser system and in October of 2003 (yes 20 years later) when I had my daughter I again am using the playtex system. There was nothing better then and is nothing better now. They are easy to clean, easy for baby to hold, convenient and most of all we have never had a problem with gassey babys. When it comes to your baby don't go for fad bottles these are by far the best and have stood the test of time.",5,1

Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat / Infant Carrier with LATCH Base - Chesapeake,No question this is a great car seat for us.  With a child that has always hated the process of getting strapped in it is a lifesaver not having to complete the task with each stop.  I truely don't find it heavy even with my little one reaching 15 lbs.  I welcome the workout.  We have the venezia stroller as well and are certainly getting our monies worth.  I absolutely love the system and dread the day we can no longer use it.  Even if it is only for 6 months at least it was a pleasant 6 months.,5,1
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Multi-Position Leatherette High Chair - Tan,"Three words for you if you're considering this high chair...SPEND THE MONEY!!!  It's only a little more than the others, but wow, what a difference in QUALITY!  And SO COOL looking!  I love that it looks like a piece of furniture in our house, not another silly looking baby toy with bears on it...not that there's anything wrong with bears... but this high chair is the bomb!  Comfortable for little baby &quot;bumpers&quot; to park on, easy as pie to use, easy breezy clean-up, and rolls effortlessly from room to room with us, adjusting to whatever heights you need, whether you're on the couch or at the kitchen table...wouldn't recommend any other!  I noticed some other reviewer commented on it being &quot;wide&quot; or something at the bottom, but I truly don't know what that's about...it's the most compact one I've seen on the market!  Apparently that person hasn't seen the other high chairs in stores... You'll love this one, trust me!  No other chair compares to the Prima Pappa!",5,1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice 8 Second Digital Thermometer,Makes it very easy to take temperatures rectally which is the most accurate way! Love how it folds and is always accurate.,5,1
First Years Premium Double Pump,"I don't really have anything to go by, but I think this pump is great. Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't hurt, it does a thorough job and it was a decent price. The only problem I have with it is that the arms sometimes move while I am pumping and I lose suction because the cup gets moved. The manufacturer should of had a locking mechanism for them. Otherwise it's a lot faster than doing it by hand!! That's for sure!I would buy this product again if I had to!",4,1
First Years Premium Single Electric Pump,"I have been using this pump for a week now, and have had no problems.  It has great suction and is very comfortable.  The only word of advice I would give is if you are going to boil the parts to sterilize, make sure you take off the plastic valve because it will lose its shape, affecting its performance.",5,1
DEX Products Mommy Bear Baby Bear MBBB-01,"This is not only a cute product, but it works well to calm a fussy baby!  The wooshing sound of the womb really does help sooth the baby to sleep!I like that there is a volume button. I found that the loudest setting is good for the first few weeks that the baby is home and eventually you can start to lower the volume. There is also a switch to play soothing music, but we have found that the baby enjoys the womb sounds much more.Each bear has a velcro strip so that it can fasten onto the crib.  My only problem is that there is only one sound box for both bears.  The box can be switched from the mommy bear to the baby bear, but I wish that each bear had it's own box so that one bear could always stay attached to the crib and the other could go downstairs with us during the day.  It's really not that big of a deal as it's easy to switch the sound boxes, but it would be nice to have 2.You'll be glad that you bought this!",4,1
Simplicity 3-In-1 Bedside Bassinet,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars it because I haven't used this bassinet yet - but I am delighted with it for the price.  It is taller than others, its options are very nice, and seems very sturdy.. a concern for us having a curious 3 yr old boy.  The pattern is hard to discern online, but the fabric is identical to the beige plaid sheets that Target sells to go w/the Waverly Vintage Rose bedding collection, which we happen to have, so I was very happy about that.  I have already purchased extra sheets by calling the customer service number on the instructions, they are $5-$6 each plus shipping.  Anyone with concerns about space might want to look at an identical Graco model at a baby store, this bassinet is larger than 'conventional' bassinets and is wide at the legs, but they are very nice because they have wheels that can lock and completely fold up when you want the bassinet to rock.  I would recommend this unit, especially for the competitive price.",4,1
Simplicity 3-In-1 Bedside Bassinet,"I am extremely satisfied with this bassinet.  It's ability to change from a traditional bassinet, bedside sleeper, and changing table was more than worth the money. I contacted the manufacturer to purchase additional sheets and they accomodated my request and were very friendly and helpful.  I recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a bassinet for themselves or as a gift.",5,1
Lamaze Bright Friends: Trotter the Pony,"We just had a grandaughter born in Sept and a granson born in Oct and are expecting another grandson in April. I bought the turtle, the monkey and trotter for them for Christmas. The 2 babies that are already here love theirs and so do I. These are the cutest toys for young babies and are so colorful and easy for young hands to hold. In fact, I'm so pleased that I purchased Celeste, the frog and the butterfly for them as Easter gifts. Also purchased the puppy, trotter and the fishbowl for my house. Wish they had toys like this when I was raising my babies.",5,1
Koala Baby - Moonbeam 6 Piece Bedding Set,"Adorable!  The bedding is gorgeous and can be used for a boy or a girl. The bedding also has a lot of accessories for the nursery.  We have the lamp, wall hangings and pillow. The colors are great and the bedding is very soft.  I originally did not like the bedding when I viewed it online, but when I saw it in the store I knew that this was it!",5,1
Koala Baby - Moonbeam 6 Piece Bedding Set,"We bought this set because we didn't find out the sex of our baby until birth and needed something that could be for either sex! We absolutely love it! We are not using the bumper right now because it didn't seem to fit right on our crib. (We have a wooden convertible crib and in the mattresses highest position, the bumper wouln't attach properly.) Once we move the mattress to a lower position, the bumper will attach fine. The pattern is so cute for either a boy or a girl!",5,1
Madison Avenue Baby Musical Mobile,"This was the first object that my baby girl really took notice to when we first brought her home. I have it set up on her changing table right now and she smiles when she sees it and moves her legs in anticipation of the music! When she was newborn and not smiling yet, she would look at it during her change and the music relaxed her. We could tell she prefered that changing area over other places in the house because of the mobile. The colors are also really soft, but still the shapes really catch her attention.",5,1
Good Night - Bear Mobile,"My baby is now 6 months old and she still loves this mobile.  Especially from age 1-4 months, they were her first friends.  She cooed to them when she was happy, she complained to them if I walked away for a minute.  She loves the music.  I used to be able to wind it up 2-3 rounds and she was happy watching them.  Now she's content just hanging out with herself or else she just wants out of the crib.  I liked them because they were pastel and classic looking (not modern).  My daughters room has antique distressed furniture in it and all pastel colors, less modern stuff.  I hope this review was helpful.",5,1
The First Years - Easy Comfort Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this pump today because my pump-in-style advanced won't be here until next week and I have to go back to school thursday. I used it as soon as I got it home. I does the job, and for 19$ you can't beat it. I looked all over for a low cost pump and it was hard to find! If you only need to pump every once and awhile go ahead and get this one... but if you are going to pump full time I would go with an electric.",4,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Halo is the first baby clothes thing I have seen that seems to be size accurate!  I swear the rest of the clothes are sized by people on crack they are so random.  So my little one is 7 months, 18 lbs, and 28 inches long.  I crossed my fingers and got him the large.  I would not put it on a baby any smaller either in length or height, but he managed to squeak in without worrying about it falling off.  If you are not quite so financially strapped I would recommend getting the size accurate to your baby :-)The sack is soft, nice weight, and I love the open arms so that I can put any variety of short-sleeve, long-sleeve onesies or even pajamas underneath.  The extra layer is not too much for heat, but just enough protection so that those early morning leaks in the full diaper from 12 hours of sleep don't go through onto the sheet.  Yay!  I also love the bottom zipper and the amount of room to grow.  Even if I had purchased the correct (medium) size for mine he would have had space.  He is perfectly happy sleeping in it and I will be buying more!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My baby has been wearing SleepSack since he came out of the swaddle so we just keep buying the bigger size.  The cotton is soft and it has washed/worn well.  We will soon buy the next size up.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This is a wearable blanket that is 100% cotton. It is not much thicker than a receiving blanket so it is better for warmer weather. There is a different fleece option from Halo that we have too for when the bedroom is a little chilly. I have used this with both my boys when they no longer want to be swaddled but you still want a little more warmth. You can layer it with a onesie t-shirt or full body pajamas. I would definately recommend this for bedtime as you can use it for multiple sizes for example 6-12 months rather than getting several different sizes of blanket sleeper pajamas. Which is especially nice when they are growing so fast and moving up through those sizes.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I purchased the sleep sack when my baby boy was about 3 months old. The weather was getting warmer and he had pretty much outgrown all the sleep gowns we had been using. After moving him out of the bassinet to his crib, it became apparent just how active he was too. The sleep sack helps keep him from getting his legs stuck in the sides of the crib, yet still allows him to roll around and play. It's not too warm, but gives him some coverage in an air-conditioned house. I definitely plan to look at a fleece version for the winter months too. I can't believe I never used these with my first son!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Our son sleeps 13 hours a night with this on !! HE cant kick off the blankets, and I know he is safe from blankets over his face.  He sleeps so well all warm and cozy.  You MUST GET THIS!!!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",These are great you can't go wrong! I used halo sleep sacks for over a year w both my kids!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Our baby was swaddled for sleep up until she was 6-months-old and started rolling over onto her stomach while swaddled.  We tried putting her in footie pajamas for sleep, but she seemed a bit restless during the night.  It was too drastic of a change from the swaddle she'd become comfortable with.  We tried this Halo SleepSack (on top of the pajamas), and she settled right down to sleep.  The SleepSack gives her the cosy comfort of a swaddle with the freedom to roll over without any safety issues.  Now we use a SleepSack every night.  We prefer the standard fabric (rather than the fleece variety).  Living in Houston, the Halo fleece fabric is too heavy and warm, even in winter.This particular design of dots is not our favorite Halo design, but it works just the same as the cuter designs.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","i love this product lets face it blankets,bumper pads,pillows and all deco in babys crib is NOT safe ilove the fact i can dress my baby in something that she loves and is SAFE and cozy she loves this when i put it on her she knows it is bed time and she starts rubbing her eyes and preparing to sleep please dont use blankets in babys crib its just NOT safe buy these they are GREAT!!!",4,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I'm a fan of the HALO sleepsacks and their functionality. It could be a positive or negative thing but this 100% Cotton HALO is made of very light and thin cotton material which is a lot different than the fleece HALO sleepsacks that I'm used to buying. However, when the weather gets really hot during the summer, I think this will be the perfect solution so I bought a larger size for my son to grow into it to use it during the warmer months.",4,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","This product is a life saver for a new mom. I was so worried about SIDS and my son getting wrapped up in a blanket. This solved my all of my worries. It is made very well and comes in a variety of sizes, so they can grow with your little one. Now that I have another on the way, I am stocking up on some new ones. I always give these as gifts to my new-mom friends.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We have used this since we quit swaddling him as a newborn. We use the cotton one year around and it is the perfect weight here in Texas. We only use the fleece one when it becomes really cold. He is 15 months old and he associates the sleepsack with sleepytime. I never have to worry about him being cold or kicking off his blankets-totally recommend!!!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My daughter wears this almost every night. The sleep sacks are super durable, soft and you can wash them many times before they ever show wear. I've used one of these through two babies.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I'm sure that this isn't true for all babies, but my little boy (5 months) loves this.  When we're putting him in his crib he'll start to cry a little, but once we put him in this he'll start giggling.  I'm not sure why he likes it so much, but it sure is cute!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",LOVE this sleepsack.  It's only one layer of cotton fabric and quite large.  I went from using a 0-6 month one (of another brand) to a medium Halo Sleepsack.  It's perfect.  My 7 month old has quite a bit of room to grow.  I do expect to buy another one until he's at least 12 months old.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",So happy we decided to get this sleep sack. Even though I read the reviews about these running big I still went with an large and even ordered an XL to have has a backup for when our little one gets bigger. My almost 6 month old began to roll over in his sleep and this sleep sack gives me peace of mind. No worries about him getting wrapped up in a blanket. The cotton is soft & adds the perfect amount of warmth to his footie pj's.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",I feel my baby is safer wearing this convenient sleepsack than wearing a blanket. And it stays on when my baby started rolling over in her sleep.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","our 16-month old kicks and moves a lot when he sleeps so this sack keeps him warm throughout the night. It is the second one we buy of this kind (had a smaller size) and we are all very happy. It is lightweight that he won't overheat yet thick enough that it keeps him warm. good quality, holds up pretty well with frequent washing at high temp. My son was swaddled for 4 months then transitioned to sleep sacks and I plan on using them for a while.",5,1
Sealy Stain Protection Crib Mattress Pad,"I have owned several mattress pads for my kids over the years and this is by far the best.  I was amazed that this pad was so soft, plush and yet works so well.  All you feel is super soft, bouyant cotton and it doesn't have any strange ""plasticy"" smell or crunchy sound like so many waterproof pads have.  It seems to have the best absorbancy yet and the fit is superb!  It is easy to apply to the mattress and yet never seems to shift or bag at the edges.  This is the first waterproof mattress pad that I have been able to put into the dryer for ONE cycle and have it come out DRY!  I know, amazing concept, isn't it?  I wash these pads on hot and dry them on medium and I have not had any shrinking or problems with wear.  I wash them weekly or more often if needed.I really recommend these pads to anyone with babies or small children.  It's always good to have 2 per child....one is always ready when the other becomes soiled (due to an accident or sickness)....and as most parents know, children tend to get sick about the same time as their siblings.  This can at least make YOUR part a little easier to manage.  Hope this was helpful.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Keeps wipes handy and much more comfortable for baby.  We had an older version of the wipee-warmer with our older child.  We have really loved this one.  The wipes stay much fresher (no browning) and don't dry out.  It is kind of a pain to wash/replace the pillows, but definitely worth the effort.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"This works well although wipes get cold really quickly. It does warm them up though. Wish it held more wipes too. Besides that, solid product.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,I just had my third child and purchased this product.  I have tried a few of the warmers out there and have found this to be the best one.  I feel safe using it as the others I have used in the past were recalled because of electrical issues.  The only complaint I have is that the instructions indicate replacing the Everfresh pad every 2-3 months and I cannot find a refill ANYWHERE!  I have contacted the company and hope to get some help from them.,4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I had this wipe warmer for my first child and loved it. For our second child I bought another brand thinking it would be as good. I was so wrong. Nothing comes close to the function of this wipe warmer. Look no further, buy this one.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I thought that a wipe warmer was a totally unnecessary product until I bought my daughter home from the hospital and saw her jump when I put the cold wipe on her bottom. Well, that convinced me to go buy a wipes warmer! Anyway, I bought this one because of the good reviews and it is a good product but there are a few flaws. After only 10 weeks of usage, the top keeps popping back up when it is closed, even though the warmer is not too full of wipes. Also, you must add water again to the sponge pack before the wipes run out otherwise the wipes will become dry towards the end of the pile and you end up wasting them.Besides these 2 flaws, the product works great!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"This warmer is just great.  I read about the brown wipes, water spills, etc. but we haven't had ANY problems.  As long as you keep the pad wet nothing turns brown.  Even when we've forgotted to wet the pad for a long time, only the pad has dried out & turned brown- none of the wipes ever did.  They just dried up a bit & weren't as warm.  And once you re-wet the pad it turns white again.  Also, I read that another poster could only get the pop up feature to work with a certain brand of wipes but we've used lots of different wipes & they all pop up fine.  I've opened the lid several times & never had any water spillage either.  The lid is curved so all the water stays inside the warmer, even the condensation drips back inside when you open it.  I really love it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the original we got as a gift didn't work at all & we had to return it & get a new one.  That one has worked just great.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Nice warmer, with its pillow  keep the wipes fresh and  moist. Great quality product !maybe the lid is small",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I bought this to go on top of my Prince Lionheart diaper caddy/organizer and use it strictly as a wipes dispenser (i.e., I don't plug it in). I like it because it stays stationary and the pop-up lid is easy to use - both features make a 2am diaper change easier. I give it 4 stars only because I can't comment in its effectiveness as a warmer.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I registered for this wipes warmer even though I wasn't sure how much we needed it.  Soon after our son was born, we started using it and we were very pleased.  Even as a newborn, our son cried much less during diaper changes when the wipes were warmed. I felt especially good about using it during the winter when diaper changes must be pretty chilly for baby!  The wipes stayed moist as long as you keep a little water in the warmer, per the instructions, and the wipes were warm, not hot.  I stopped using the warmer in the spring, but I plan on getting it out again now that cold weather is back.  While it may seem unneccesary at first, I'm sure most of us wouldn't feel that way if we were the ones being changed several times a day!  All in all, a great purchase and/or gift.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"I have been using this warmer for nearly eight months and love it.  Every now and again the latch stops working.  At first, I blamed my husband for forgetting to close it.  Once I realzed that the latch, and not the Dad, was the problem, I contacted the manufacturer.  They suggested that I gently pull the tab toward the front of the unit when it stopped staying shut.  It seems that the heat of the unit causes the problem.  Now that I know the ""trick,"" all is well.  As for the complaints about which wipes work as pop-ups, I have found that the Babies R Us brand (Especially for Baby) work wonderfully!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"We have been using this warmer for 18 months and we love it.  Others have said that this is a ""luxury item"", but I disagree.  Spending $20 on something that you'll use for years to make diaper changes more comfortable for the baby isn't a ""luxury"" to me.  Does your baby need this to survive, of course not...  but isn't it our job to make our little ones as happy and comfortable as possible?I have read the negative reviews some people have written on this warmer and I have to say - READ THE DIRECTIONS PEOPLE!The Ever-Fresh pillow is not supposed to keep the wipes moist for 3 months without re-wetting it.  The directions clearly state ""Add water as necessary.  Do not allow Ever-Fresh to dry out.""  This is not difficult, we just re-wet the pad every time we refill the warmer (about once a week).  You are supposed to replace the pad every 3 months (for best results), but we have not replaced it that often.  We replace the pad when it starts loosing its softness and it stays a little brown after re-wetting.As far as people complaining that the wipes are ""freezing cold"" by the time they get to the baby - they must live at the North Pole.  Yes, the wipes will cool down a little once you remove them from the warmer (simple physics people), but they are nowhere near being cold.  This warmer really does make a difference in the wipe temperature.  We travel frequently and my son always ""protests"" when unwarmed wipes touch his bottom (he tries to pull away and says ""cold"").  He never does this at home with the warm wipes.  I have tried warming the wipes with my hands, but that doesn't seem to do anything at all.  We are going to be spending a lot of time up North this winter, so we are buying another warmer for Grandma's house.We use Huggies ""reach-in"" wipes and they work great.  I haven't tried the ""pop-up"" wipes so I can't comment on those.  We use `reach-in' so I can buy the big box of replacement wipes and use it to refill the wipe warmer and the travel wipe cases.Hope this information helps you!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Great product, it was the best thing I ever bought to my baby, now I buy as a gift to all my pregnant girlfriends, it's a must have !!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Whoever gave a negative review because the moisture on the top spilled out a little when you open the top, get over it!!! Just put a small towel under it or use the Diaper Depot.  This wipes warmer is the best one I've tried so far and I've had it for 5 months now.  The wipes are ALWAYS moist and warm and never brown. My son loves the warm wipes, they don't startle him at those 3A.M. changes! The reason I left off one star is because the Ever Fresh refills are very hard to find. They should sell them wherever they sell this warmer. HAPPY CHANGINGS!!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"We've tried three different wipes warmers and this is the best one yet.  We haven't had any brown wipes, they are always moist.  Pampers wipes do work better than Huggies wipes because of the way they are packaged- the pampers wipes are folded into each other so when you pull one out it pulls another out.  The Huggies don't do this and then you have to open up the compartment each time which is aggravating.  Also, you really do have to keep on top of the ""pillow""- it dries out and gets brown and hard pretty quickly, about every 4-5 days I've found so you have to remember to keep rewetting it.  The refill pillows are $7 a pack so I try to make them last as long as possible- it's worth it though because there haven't been any brown wipes unlike the other brands I tried.  However, I've been diligent about keeping my pillows wet and I haven't had to open a new pack yet- we've been using the same one for three and a half months.Overall, a great product- the best one I've found so far!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,Not as warm as I'd like but works. The drop in dries up before the called for week is over and turns brown and gets hard. More like wet it every 2-3 days. Also I have tried both kinds of wipes in it disposable and cloth and neither really pull through very well.,4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,This is a must have. Every time id go to wipe my daughter she would jump and cry. She hated cold wipes. Getting this has made a world of difference. She doesnt mind getting changed now.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"This is one of the best gifts I received for my baby shower.  The warm wipes really help to get that ""stuck on"" poop off my babies bottom without having to rub hard. I use the Wal-Mart brand, White Cloud, wipes with this warmer.  They are pop-up and much softer and cheaper than any other wipes I have used.  Every time I refill the wipes, I wet the sponge, and I have never had a wipe turn brown or dry out.THIS IS A DEFINITE FOR ANY NEW MOM!!!!!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,A great product! Babies deserve to be pampered &amp; this is an easy way to make sure the diaper changing experience is comfy!!,5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,I think this product is great.  I found that Huggies wipes work the best in this.  I bought the refill pop up pack and they worked great.  The Pampers wipes did not pop up well at all.  I also found that by keeping a small bottle of water near the warmer helped to remind me to keep water inside of the warmer.  I found that if you fill the bottom of the warmer to the top of the warming pad it works the best.  I poured more water in each time I refilled the wipes.  I think this is a great product and my son loves it.,4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Of course, a wipe warmer is not an essential piece of baby equipment, but it sure is nice on a cold night! I'm sure the baby appreciates not having her warm bottom shocked by a cold wipe (I wouldn't!).We have had this wipe warmer for three years, using it every day, and it is still going strong. I guess we'll be using it for a few more years since we've just added another little one to our family. I like that it allows wipes to come out one by one, always bringing the corner of the next wipe out for the next use. So the next wipe is always very easy to pull out. No digging around for a wipe. The replacement pads need to be moistened each week, in my experience. I simply hold the warmer under the faucet and pour water into it down the side. The pad soaks up the water and thus keeps all the wipes moist. I've had to replace the pad about every 2 months or so and sometimes haven't remembered to do so, or have forgotten to add water. Then it gets a bit brown, but I've just removed the lower few wipes when I threw the used pad out and continued. The pads are a little pricey, though. But my husband and I agree that we prefer warm wipes to cold ones for our little ones' bottoms.The wipe warmer is a bit bigger than your standard wipe container, but it looks nice. The night light is a nice touch too.Great product.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"Used one for a month now and love it! So, I bought another.  One for upstairs bedroom and one for lower floor where baby is most of the day.The only thing its missing in my opinion is a auto shut off/on timer of some sort.  So much of electricity is wasted by keeping it on all day long. So, I bought one of those electrical outlet timers that turn on/off at set times in a day.  The upstairs warmer is off all day and turns on at 9 PM until 9 AM.  It should not be too hard to incorporate because theseWestek TM01DHB Daily Timer, Whitetimers are available for as cheap as $4 in home depot.  With one such timer, this would be the better than what it already is!",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"We thought a wipes warmer was optional, so didn't buy. After our first baby was born, we used cold wipes, and he flinched and cried. Went out and got a wipes warmer by Prince Lionheart, and the flinching and crying stopped at dipaer changes. We use only until this day Pampers Sensative wipes (bought some Huggies - thick, hard, crumbly, and chill down in an instant). Pampers wipes are made differently, and are soft and comfortable for baby. Buy about a half dozen of the wipes warmer pads (Babies R Us carriess), and use one pad at a time at bottom of warmer (should last about 2-3 months). Always add a full cup of water to every batch of wipes you put in warmer, so no brown wipes at bottom. They advertise no brown wipes, but all wipes warmers will brown wipes once the moisture in warmer is at a certain level. Both of our wipes warmers have been going strong for 3 years now.",4,1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,This wipe warmer stopped the screaming at night.  Now my husband can sleep since he has to go to work at 5:30.  The baby really hated the cold wipes in the middle of the night.  Works great in the bedroom for this purpose.,5,1
TOT-Co Toilet Trainer,"I had been looking for a potty for my 16 month old daughter. All the pottys looked the same except for the totco potty. Having a potty that resembles what her parents use has been a large part of her immediate acceptance and willingness to sit on the potty right away. After a very short time we have had """"potty success."""" When she is done she loves closing the lid and flushing the toilet . These features again resemmble what she has already seen with mom & dad. We're extremely happy with our purchase!",4,1
Dreamscapes Soother,"I don't typically write reviews...but wanted to share my experiences with LeapFrog's Dreamscapes Soother.  Our daughter just turned 2 in November.  I purchased the product when she was an infant.  When she moved from the crib to a twin bed (when she was about 20 months old), I attached bed side rails.  I knew I had to find a way to attach the soother to the rails, because she uses it EVERY night.  It's her bedtime ritual and she presses it over and over again until she finally falls asleep.  Not only does it have soothing music (which I've never grown tired of), but it acts as a night light while she's still awake (while the pictures are scrolling).  I don't know what we would have done without it.  We have several LeapFrog items, including LittleTouch LeapPad, Discovery Ball, LeapStart Learning Table, Learning Drum and FridgePhonics (which we've had since she was 12 months old, and she can almost recite the entire alphabet).  Regardless of the fact that I have to purchase batteries every 4-6 weeks (approximately), WE LOVE the DREAMSCAPES SOOTHER and highly recommend it!",5,1
Dreamscapes Soother,"I have to agree with the reviews that you will go through quite a few batteries but not as often as what I thought after reading some of the reviews.  But it is well worth it, especially when your child learns to turn it on themselves and goes back to sleep, giving you an extra hour of sleep!  Our daughter is now a year old, and still loves this toy and we take it wherever she will be sleeping, even for naps.  The volume can be adjusted to suit your preference and the moving pictures are very calming and slowly dim as the music becomes softer. It is super easy to take on and off of the crib and can set on a dresser or shelf if you would like.  We had the aquarium crib toy and found it to be loud and didn't play long enough at one time.  The Dreamscape Soother is the perfect choice for any baby!",4,1
Dreamscapes Soother,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months.  She is now 11 months and still loves to go to sleep with it.  She knows how to turn it on and uses it in the morning when she is waiting for someone to come get her.  However, know that the batteries get used up extremely fast with this toy.  Also, we have already been through two light bulbs.  It is still worth it.  We take it on trips and it makes her feel very comfortable.  She knows it is time for bed when we turn it on.",5,1
Dreamscapes Soother,"I was having a huge problem getting my son to sleep in his own room.  However, when I put the Dreamscape Soother in his crib he would fall right to sleep.  Now he sleeps in there all night every night.  This product also has a night light and a volume control button which are two excellent items to have at night.  Great product!!!",5,1
"Noah's Patch Wall Border by NoJo, Noah's Ark, 5 Yards Per Roll",I have never put up a border so easy!  My husband and I had no problem with the prepasted paper adhereing to the wall.  All we did was wet the wall paper and put it up.  We put one entire roll up without cutting it at all.  I was surprised to see it go up without any problems.  The edges have plenty of paste to keep them from pulling away from the wall.  (Hint: get a laser level the put constistant level line all the way around the room.  This makes the job go so quickly!)  We painted the room in 2 tone.  The top is yellow and the bottom is green.  We love it.,5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I cannot say enough good things about this product.  When I had my daughter I received a big old hand-me-down Graco stroller from a relative, but hated trying to get it all situated when I just needed to run in the store for something.  It was the old kind that the carrier didn't snap into, but I didn't want to get one of those big bulky systems, either.  Then a friend told me about the Snap 'N Go, and I can't tell you how happy I am!!!It was so easy to assemble, easy to figure out how to adjust the bars, and SUPER lightweight... very comparable to an umbrella stoller in weight.  I would just lift the carrier out of the car and right into this, it's so easy!  It also rides VERY well, and the basket in the bottom is so large, I can even go to the grocery store for small trips.The best thing is that it saves you so much money over buying one of the (bulky) travel systems.  Once my daughter outgrew (at about 6 months old), I just bought a cheap-o stroller without all the bells and whistles, which did the job for another six months until she was big enough for an umbrella stroller.This is now the gift I give at every baby shower I attend... whether the mother has registered for it or not!  I now use it for my son.",5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,Very convenient to use. Better than the bulkier stroller. Much lighter to carry and easier to lift in and out of your car. Folds very easy.,5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"When we found out we were having triplets, we like all other multiple parents bought a stroller to accommodate all the babies. The stroller is so large that we can not even fit it into a mini van. We have to purchase a large SUV or Full size van to go anywhere.We bought the Latch Lock carriers from baby trend and we just love them. When we saw the stroller that went along with them. We decided to order the Double Snap N Go.The stroller comes all put together, you just need to snap on the wheels. Then comes the fun part. The stroller is made for many different brands of carriers. You find the carrier you are using in the instruction manual and then you remove bars or rearrange them to fit your carrier. It is very simple and all the parts are well labeled.The carriers just snap on to the top, just like when you snap them into the base that is in the car. There is a strap that goes over the lower half of the carrier to prevent it from rocking or coming off the stroller. It is great because you do not have to unsnap your baby from the car seat and them snap them into the stroller. No need to transfer toys and blankets from car seat to stroller. What a time saver.It is very light weight and easy to set up. I pull it out of the trunk and just snap and lock it into place. I then just snap the carriers in place and we are off. It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.For all you shoppers out there. I took the stroller into a women's clothing store and was able to easily navigate the store. The stroller handles very well. The front wheels are adjustable. You can set them for straight ahead or let them rotate.Because we have 3 babies, we easily become a tourist attraction. The stroller handles so well that I was able to move swiftly and accurately through spectators and display racks.We love the Double Snap N Go so much that we have asked for the Single Snap N Go for our Baby Shower.",5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"Loved this stroller.  My friends are envious.  It is lightweight, easy to use, manuevers great with one hand, folds with one hand.  I love it...love it love it.  Only bad point...the cup holders suck, but I like using it for chapstick, cell phone and sunglasses.",5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,This is a very light and easy to operate stroller.  Works great with the Crago infant car sit.  I'm glad I didn't purchase the travel system since its stroller was much heavier.,5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,It's inexpensive and very light.  I wanted the smallest infant stroller possible so we bought this one.  It folds up very small and we throw it around everywhere and it's still together.  I would highly recommend this stroller.  We have the Graco Snug Ride and it's compatible.,5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM NOT TOO LONG AGO AND IT IS GREAT. PERFECT FOR QUICK SHOPPING AND EASY TO MANAGE. LIGHT WIEGHT, CAN OPEN AND CLOSE WITH ONE HAND. FOR SHORT TRIPS AND WALKS IN THE MALL IT IS GREAT. WE USE ARE PRAM FOR LONG WALKS BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE WE USE THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!",5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I absolutely love the combo of the babytrend carseat with this stroller frame (very very fast and easy). I wish my baby doesn't have to out grow it. My husband and I take the baby everywhere with us (he bought me the BT Jogger also) we never have to wake the baby when going from place to place. The stroller folds up very easy, weighs almost nothing, strolls through tight squeezes and fits in our trunk (which has a huge ported sub) and also in the backseat (jogger does too). We drive a 2003 Corolla.",5,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,I have a two month old and have found this to be one of the best baby items.  It is so light-weight and works well with the Graco infant seat.  The turning radius is so wonderful that I can spin around completely in the middle of a narrow JoAnn's aisle!  This is great alternative to a bulky travel system... and less expensive.,5,1
Dr. Brown's Deluxe Wide Neck Bottle Starter Kit - 3 pack,"No spit ups, no gas, no bubbles in the bottle. My 10 week old son doesn't spit after drinking from these bottles. The wide neck bottles, in my opinion, reduces the nipple confusion, since the nipple is soft and wide as the [...]. These are working great for me. I don't mind cleaning the few extra parts, its not a big deal at all.Update after a year: Still using the Dr.Brown bottles (the bigger size). No problems what so ever!!! Still love them.",5,1
Gossamer Wings 5 Piece Wall hanging,I really like these wall hangings. I was just dissapointed they were pretty wrinkled and the ribbons are so thin. But they do look great in my baby girls room!,4,1
Gossamer Wings 5 Piece Wall hanging,"I bought these to go with the Gossamer Wings set.  They could be put in many other rooms I 'm sure because of the varitey of colors. I think they make a great addition to the room and for 5 of them, the price is right for the quality of the wall hanging!  I have these in three different place of my baby's room. They are very pretty and would make a great addition to any room!",5,1
Baby Einstein Discover &amp; Play Sun Activity Toy,My daughter received this toy when she was 2 mos old. She enjoyed the toy then and now at 5 mos really loves chewing on the toy and it is light enough she can easily handle it. I would definitely recommend this toy!,5,1
Gossamer Wings Wall Border,"I bought this border, and a friend of mine and my husband hung it. It turned out very nice, I was almost a little afraid after reading some of the other reviews but it wasn't bad at all, I think it took them a couple of hours to get it finished but we are very happy with the finished product.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My son had a hard time with taking in too much air with the Avent bottles.  He constantly threw up and was always uncomfortable after his feedings.  I bought these on the suggestion of a friend and can't thank her enough for the advice!  These have reduced the amount of air my little guy takes in and he's much happier.  I've heard people complain about what a pain it is to clean all the parts and that you can't have the nipple on when you heat the bottle, but I see these as small inconveniences that I can put up with since my son's feedings have improved so greatly.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","Unfortunately, I was only about to bf my son for about 2 weeks until we had to switch to formula feeding. We tried everything. Started at the regular evenflo, went to the playtex, then the avent, and it seemed like no matter what we did, he just threw everything up. He started dropping weight and we freaked. My mother walked into babies r us and said, ""I want the best bottle here. Period."" The sales clerk handed her a 3 pack of the Dr Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and that did the trick. My baby is no longer gassy and whiny. He does still spit up a little on occassion... but he's a baby. They tend to do that.Overall, I would recommend the Dr Brown's bottles, wholeheartedly. I just wish we would've found them before I spent so much money on all the other bottles we got.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","These bottles are the best.  We tried them all - Playtex, Advent Etc and for less gas and less fussing these worked!  They are a must have for nursing mom's! My son was much more acceptable of the nipple on these bottles than any of the others we tried!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","I have a three week old who is primarily breast feeding, I have started to give her one bottle with breast milk a day since she was five days old, for ease/convinience.  I first started using the Avent bottles, with this product, my baby would frequently spit up, and more milk would end up ON her than IN her.  As well she had problems latching onto the breast with her next feeding.  I then tried the Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles, which are excellent, she has no problems using these bottles, no spiting up/overspill etc....  and most importantly no problems latching onto the breast, I have been able to give her both the bottle and breast in one feeding without any problems.  Cleaning has a few extra steps, but it is definitely worth it!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My son took a bottle for the first time around 4 weeks of age.  We would try to give him one bottle a day while I nursed him the other feedings.  Because of many recommendations, I went out and bought loads of Avent bottles, but when my son drank from them, he gulped, choked, and got milk all over himself (even after trying all of the nipple sizes).  Finally, he began to reject the bottle and I was forced to be at home every time he needed to eat so I could nurse him.  That loss of freedom hit me hard, so in desperation, I went out and got a Dr. Brown's bottle, because they were another brand that I saw had great recommendations.  With the first try, he took the Dr. Brown's bottle perfectly!  There was no gulping, choking, or mess, and I received some of my freedom back!  My son is happier, I'm happier, and I'm thankful for Dr. Brown's bottles for making that happen.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","I breast feed our son, now 3 months old, and have pumped my milk from the beginning.  We started him out with Avent bottles and had nothing but problems.  The bottles leaked and the nipple, even the smallest size, tended to release too much milk.  For the first few weeks of our son's life he had milk all over his face when he ate and he looked like a drunken sailor!  He also had a problem with gas and spitting up and we went through a gallon of Mylicon. We tried other bottles, Evenflo etc. and once we used the Dr. Brown's bottles our problems were solved!  We have not used a drop of Mylicon since we got them!  There are no probelms with gas or spitting up.  As for cleaning, I prefer to hand wash all bottles just to make sure they are really, really clean so I don't mind the extra pieces.  These bottles are worth every penny!",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"My baby loves her play gym!  It's colorful and she loves the mirror and rattles and all the accessories.  The couple of issues I have with it are not major.  First, I had to tear 23 tags off all the little do-dads and the mat and such.  23! (They are really stiff tags so I didn't want her to scratch herself with them)The star that lights up and plays songs is great for tummy time... it gives her something to look at.  But there is no volume control, and it seems a little loud (she's scared herself awake when she moves it and it starts playing the music).I also feel it's a little pricey for what it is.  If I hadn't received it as a shower gift, I'd never have purchased it myself.",4,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"I am so happy i bought this play mat! We first put our daughter ella under when she was about a week old, and she loved it! She spends hours looking up at all the toys, and i am even ablt to hang our own toys with the extra links it came with. The arches are so stable, and we love the pillow for babies head. Well worth the money!",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"We started using this playgym for our daughter when she was just three weeks old; it was her first toy!  She loved looking at the star that lights up and plays music.  Then around two months old, she started batting at the dangling toys. At three and a half months, she realized that if she shakes the bars by kicking them, SHE can make the music come on.  And at four months, she started rolling over on this mat.  It has been so much fun seeing her laugh and smile and hit all of these milestones while on the Baby Einstein mat!  And now at six months, she still uses it everyday.  I would highly recommend this mat to any new parent to purchase or put on your registry!  It's safe, educational, and fun for your child.  What more could you ask for?",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"I have a 10 week old son who is extremely fussy and colicky. For the first 6 weeks of his life, I couldn't put him down (awake) without him screaming and crying. Then I borrowed the Baby Einstein Playgym from a friend to see what he thought, and I ended up ordering one that day! My son LOVES it, especially the musical star that lights up. He can lay down and be captivated by it for 30 minutes or more sometimes!! My fussy little sweetheart kicks his legs and waves his arms and is so excited when he watches the star. I used 4 of the links to make the ladybug reach down to his arms, and he can even activate the star when I put it on ""motion activated"". What a lifesaver this toy has been for me----I can actually take a shower or unload the dishwasher without having to listen to a screaming baby!! :)",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,My son absolutely loves this toy! He can spend what seems like hours just laughing and looking at the star. He really enjoys his time on this playmat. It was a great shower gift from a couple of friends. I highly recommend this playmat.,5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"This mat is great. The toys are versatile and can be used anywhere - car, stroller, table, etc. My son LOVES the star and we take take it everywhere in case he gets too fussy.",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"My husband and I bought this before our son was born.  We liked the bright colors and the toys hanging from the sides, as well as the musical star.  I thought that it would be a few months before our son could use it, but we put him in it at 4 weeks and he immediately was hooked!  He could activate the motion feature on his own at 8 weeks and loves the lights on the star.  I love that everything is moveable, so as he grows we can increase the difficulty level.  People have complained about the rabbit picture, but I put a picture of our family's faces in the holder, and my son will gurgle and talk to them instead.  He loves grabbing the round rattle and talking to the lady bug and bird.  It is so fun to watch him in his gym that we took it with us out of state when we visited the grandparents!  Be sure to keep the plastic container it comes in so travel is easier.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this gym to new parents!",5,1
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,This product has revolutionized my daughter's &quot;tummy time&quot;. There is so much for her to do and she actually is enjoying the time on her belly now. I would recommend this product to anyone!,5,1
Gerber Bare Basics Gift Set,"This has to be the best wash and lotion there is.  I tried this, Johnson's, Target, and Baby Magic on my son in 2003.  During bath time this had the strongest scent and it stayed on my son without breaking him out.  I did not use the oatmeal because they did not have it out yet.  They only had Berry and Lavender at the time and we just stuck with those two.  After his bath we do massages.  This is the honest truth, when we used Gerber Lavender he went limp and just looked at me with those big blue eyes that started to get a lil sleepy the longer we massaged.  Now with the other brands he just would not relax completely.  When he bacame a little older we let him pick the lotions and wahes and he always picked Gerber Lavender.  The Target is okay in a pinch and has the next strongest fragrance out of Baby Magic and Johnson's but the others are a waste of money because they don't have a good strong scent and will not relax my son. Try this and you will love it!",5,1
Sassy Baby's First Toys 6 Piece Gift Set,"My son wants to chew on everything. He may not be teething just yet but he is interested in putting things into his mouth. These are the best little toys to let him gnaw on and generally play. What I love about the toys is the variety of color, texture and shape. It is great to help an infant develop various motor skills and can entertain him for hours. They are also easy to clean after my baby has had fun with them or dropped them on the floor. I would buy these for any friends who are going to have a baby.The price is also appealing. You can buy some of the toys individually but you receive a better deal by buying the set.",5,1
Sassy Baby's First Toys 6 Piece Gift Set,"Folks, this is an outrageous price for this product.  Other Amazon sellers sell them for much less, and Amazon itself sells them for $16.99 (and it's eligible for free shipping if you have signed up for Amazon Prime).Or, look at other websites. Justkidsstore dot com has 'em for $13.59, and even Target sells them for 26.99.This vendor is just trying to make a killing on this product.  For shame.",5,1
SASSY Bath and Sun VISOR baby kids tub sunblock NEW,"To parents of children with ear tubes: My daughter has tubes and not only do we have to keep water out of her ears but she does not like it when water pours on her face during hair washing. I decided to give this product a try. It works pretty good to keep the water off her face and she actually will wear it without a fight. We have the red(I don't know if they are shaped different) and it bends her ears to deflect some of the water, but some still runs down by her ears. Our trick is that our ENT gave us these Great ear plugs called ""doc's proplug"" they have a website, [...]. We use them together with the visor and bathtime is a MUCH easier task!!! Hope this helps other parents with the same problems.",4,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,"I gave this sling 4 stars because, even though it is not the best sling available, it is a very good way to get started with baby wearing. It is also one of the only brands of slings available in stores, at least in my area, but it is relatively cheap at $29 (compared to $30 and up for some other brands) and you can return it easily if it doesn't work for you. Advantages: The sling allows you to carry your baby in a zillion positions.  You can, with practice, breastfeed very discreetly with the sling. (I marched in a parade while breastfeeding my four-week-old in this sling!) The padded rails are great for a novice slinger with a newborn because you can arrange the fabric &amp; rails to give the baby's head a lot of support.  Drawbacks: The sling is difficult to adjust to a very small-framed person because of the amount of fabric and the padded rails. The padding also makes the sling bulky.  The fabric is not very attractive (if you look at your sling as an accessory).  The sling might be too warm for people in hot climates.A note on slinging:Even though this might not be the BEST sling out there, slings in general are a fabulous way to enjoy life with baby. Wearing your baby throughout part or all of the day will allow you to do housework, go on walks, enjoy outings, etc., while interacting and bonding with your child. Sling babies are more organized, calmer, and cry less than infants who are put in cribs or plastic buckets (carriers) all the time. They spend more time in the quiet alert state and absorb all of the amazing sights and sounds of Mom or Dad's world. If you have never used a sling before, this one's relatively low cost makes it worth trying. If you're a practiced babywearer, I would consider another brand that is tailored more for your particular size &amp; shape. You can also check out [...] for a lot of good reviews and resources for slinging.",4,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,If you are a new mom - order this now!  I  takes a few days to get used to but once you get comfortable it is a miracle.  My baby fusses I put her right in like the picture shows and walk around or do stuff around the house and she is out like a light.  The padding on the edge is nice for the baby's head and the shoulder pad works as a pillow for small infants.  Give it a try you and your baby will be happy you did!,5,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,"What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs. My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take ""piggy"" out for a walk. With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me. The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one.",4,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,"This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a ""bucket"" for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can ""wear the baby down"" in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!",5,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,I love this carrier!  It was great when I ventured out to the grocery store the other day by myself.  Usually I would just take his car seat in with me and hope for the best.  We'd make it half way through the store and he would get fussy.  I'd spend the rest of the time carring him in one arm and trying to push the cart with the other.  Now I'm able to make it all the way through the store with him in his carrier.  My sholders did ache a little by the time  we were done shopping but that's to be expected when carrying a 15 lb. baby around for over an hour.,5,1
Medela Pump In Style Traveler Breast Pump,"I went back to work when my son was 3 months old, and had purchased this pump because I had heard many good things about the pump in style. I like the fact that this comes in a backpack, and at first glance doesn't look like a breatpump. I only have 1/2 hour to pump at work, and the double pump allows me to empty both breasts and still have a few minutes to clean up. The only drawback is the fact that Medela bottles are too small, (I pump 8 oz from each breast at a time), and my son does not like the nipples. To solve that problem, I purchased several sets of Playtex's One Step Breastmilk storage kits. The adaptor ring fits right onto the pump, and allows me to pump into a 4 or 8 oz liner. When I get home, the bottles go right into the freezer, and when my husband needs one, he puts it in warm water and then into the bottle. It makes pumping, storing and feeding our son so much easier. I would recommend this pump to anyone who will be going back to work but wants to continue giving their child breastmilk.",5,1
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Yes, they can open if dropped just right or you have a savy toddler. My 19m old has only ever opened one once and I think it was sheer luck. I like these cups because they are dishwasher friendly (top rack only though) and I dont hurt the bank too much if one is left behind some place. I will note that after awhile it seems like the holes stretch and more liquid can pour out. But hey who can complain with a price like this! : ).. I love love the bright colors and the girl colors these come in too.",5,1
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I could almost copy my review of the straw cups by the same brand!  They do leak through the drinking holes, but not badly.  My daughter set one upside down and I didn't notice it for 10 minutes.  There was really only a small wet spot on the rug despite the cup being half full.  We have some fancier sippy cups with leak valves, etc, which don't leak at all but I find it annoying to wash the extra pieces (we don't have a dishwasher) so I use these more.Also, the same as my straw cups, the lid does not screw on so can come loose.  I have NEVER had it completely pop off, even being tossed over the side of her high chair.  It can come lose partway, then pop off completely if it keeps being dropped.  I just make sure the lid is still on tightly and have not had a problem.",4,1
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",These are great for traveling or just using around the house! They are pretty durable but don't have a stopper so they leak if left tipped over. But they are cheap and easy to throw away if needed!,5,1
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","A handful of throwaway sippy cups are good to have on hand (and in the diaper bag). Not that I'm advocating trashing these after use (they're perfectly washable), but your wallet won't care so much when your child chucks one of these into the okapi enclosure at the zoo. (The zookeepers care. Yes, they do.)",4,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Bowls, 8 Ounce, 6 Pack",These are nice for snacks. My daughter carries these around. They are great for traveling also. I just put the top on and go. We have not thrown them away. Not sure why you would want to chunk these in the garbage. I put them in the dishwasher when they are dirty and I have not had any problems.,5,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Bowls, 8 Ounce, 6 Pack",These are the perfect size storage bowls for a child's snack. I also used them to store cereal for my infant (I make homemade cereal and the batch usually lasts three days so I can portion them correctly using these bowls. The lid is great because my older child (1-2) can carry them around the house and not spill anything.,5,1
"Prince Lionheart Dishwasher Basket, Infant","I haven't had a baby in my house for 19 years.....but, I still have a need for this basket.  We put all of our small items in it that we don't want clanking around the dishwasher loose.  This is a great buy!",5,1
"Sassy Feeding Plates, Colors May Vary","The dividers on the segmented plates are not rounded so these plates are hard to clean.  You'd be better off buying the cheap plastic segmented plates at Walmart.  That being said, the basic plates that are not divided are GREAT.  I didn't really start using these plates much until after my son was older and had learned not to throw his plate since these have no suction to keep them in place. The lids are awesome for a finicky toddler because if he refuses dinner I can snap the lid on, pop it in the fridge, and pull it back out when he's hungry.  I originally gave this product a bad review, but I have a much higher opinion of it now that my son is older.",4,1
Baby Einstein: Caterpillar Cooling Water-Filled Teether - colors may vary,"I am surprised by the other reviews stating that this teething ring had a smell.  Maybe there was just a bad batch or two because the one I have never smelled at all.  Also, I have had it for a long time now and it has not chipped like one unfortunate reviewers has.  It is cute and colorful and catches baby's eye.  However, my kids have never really been big fans of teething rings or toys and this one was no exception.  My kids liked holding it when it was cold (having put it in the freezer etc.) but once it was no longer cool the excitement of it was gone.",4,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple, 3 Pack","I have long been a fan of Dr Browns. We purchased these nipples for feeding our baby formula with rice cereal. He has reflux so he has to have the formula thickened with the cereal. Ihad a hard time choosing between these and the Y cut nipples. I had used the Y cut nipples in the past for our son who was a preemie and had to have his formula mixed with alot of rice cereal. I was afraid Y cut nipples would flow too fast with only a small amount of cereal added. The nipples work perfect. They are also more durable than the Y cut nipples, which do break easily. Also, these are the best bottles for colic and gas.",5,1
Jeep Liberty Renegade - Traditional Walker,"Despite the warnings about the safety of walkers, if you live in a one story home with lots of hardwood floors, treat your baby to this great walker. My six-month old baby squeals when we put her in the Jeep walker. She holds the steering wheel tight and honks the horn like crazy (just like mommy). She has already learned how to manuever the Jeep and runs to me across the room when I call her over. Her legs are getting so strong, and her coordination is improving every day. It's a fun little treat for her, and a delight for us to watch. Highly recommended.",5,1
Harmony Breastpump,"I have the electric Pump-In-Style and I prefer to use the Harmony 9 times out of 10. It's very quick to set up, easy to use and easy to clean.  I think it works as well as the electric, but if you're pumping constantly throughout the day, the electric would be better for you. I'm a stay at home mom and I only need to pump occassionally (nights out away from baby, during naps to stock milk supply in freezer, etc) and I think this pump works perfectly!",5,1
Harmony Breastpump,"I received this pump while in the hospital having latch problems.  I received the Avent Isis as a shower gift.  I must say that the Harmony is a MUCH better pump than the Isis.  This pump is very easy to use and clean...not too many moving parts and it is comfortable on my breasts.  I'd suggest getting this pump over the Isis any day.  It will """"leak"""" from the bottom IF you don't use it properly (according to the manual).  I've found just by tilting it a little I can stop all leaking.",4,1
Sassy Car Wash Bath Toy,"so much handier when riding a bike or driving, vs. the screw top my sigg bottle came with. This should be an option on every bottle at time of purchase.",5,1
Sassy Car Wash Bath Toy,"My son received this toy as a present, when he was just 10 months old. He is now three-and-a-half and STILL LOVES playing with it! Yes, the cars were a little hard to get thru the ""carwash"", at first, but after constant play, the little sponges softened up and the cars squeeze thru, with little difficulty. The sprayer still works and the cars are holding up well, with little evidence of wear. This toy has made bathtime a pleasure for the past 2 years.",5,1
Sassy Car Wash Bath Toy,"This toy is a HUGE hit in our bathtub.  At first, it was a giant pain because my 2 yr old boy got it for his birthday and his 5 year old sister got enormously and inexplicably jealous.  Then we went through a phase where they both played with it alot.  Now it is all his, and the kid just loves it.  He is a bigtime car boy, and he loves this silly toy.",5,1
Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat tan,"When I was pregnant, I saw this carseat and knew that it was the one I had to have. I liked how the print didn't seem to favor one sex. Most of the seats in the store are blue or have little animals all over it (I'm not big on those animal prints.) Anyway, my daughter is now 4 months old and I haven't had a problem yet. I love the infant head insert. She just seems more snug and comfortable in it. And I absolutely love the big canopy. It's so much bigger than the rest. In response to those saying that the handle clicks too loud, just hold the parts in some so that when they snap into place, they don't click. Either way, my daughter is now used to the click it makes. Now I just can't wait to buy the 3-1 convertable carseat for her! :)",5,1
Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat tan,"I was completely happy with my Eddie Bauer Infant Car Seat.  I needed one because my new granddaughter was visiting from out of state.  The car seat looked nearly brand new.  It was easy to use and both the baby and her mother were pleased with it.  With the base in the car, we used the car seat both in the house and for travel safety.  Both baby and her mother were pleased with it.  We plan to use it for this baby, and for more grandchildren in the future.",5,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"I just bought this car seat for my 8 month old son.  I have a 1997 honda civic, and for a compact car, I think it fits just fine in the rear facing position.  My father installed it for us, and yes, it did take alot of time.  If you install it properly it should be fine.  If it is not right, I would suggest to go to the police station to see if it is installed properly. Apparently, everyone has their own opinions, but I think it is so much easier to put him right in that than the infant carrier that was so heavy for me.  I love it! Good luck!",4,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,I purchased this seat almost 2 years ago for my then 6 month old son.  When I purchased it is was missing the LATCH system.  I called the co. and they overnighted them to me.  The seat takes up a lot of room (especially when rear facing). I have a Infiniti I-30 and am not able to put it in the center it had to be placed on the side.The only problem that I have had is it is difficult to take apart to clean the seat.  With a 2 1/2 year old (potty training) it is a pain!  But I think I would have the same issue with any car seat.  My son loves it.  It is comfortable and living in south Louisiana it is not too hot like the thicker seats!  I would recommend it and will probably purchase another just like it when I have a second child.,4,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,We are very satisfied with this car seat.  We have 3 car seats by this brand name.  All have worked well.  No complaints.,5,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"At 4 months old my son was to big for his &lt;22lb infant seat.  On a budget and wanting a seat that will grow with him, we pick this one.  We have a Chevy Blazer and it is a snug fit, but my son is very comfortable it.  Guaranteed to put him to sleep.  We just had to put a towel under the back side of it to make it recline better.  It is very easy to get him in and out.  Best of all it goes up to 100lbs.  With the next baby we will go staight to this car seat.",4,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"This car seat does have a bad smell.  I took all the covers off and washed it and it still smelled, but it has pretty much aired out over the last 3 months that I've had it.  The covers are extremely hard to take off for washing.  As far as the safety of it, I really feel like my daughter is safe in it.  I have leather seats and I've had other car seats slide around, but this one stays put.  She seems comfortable in it too.  Overall I like the car seat, but washing is a HUGE pain!  The safety and comfort for my daughter are what matters most to me, and I feel like this car seat provides those two things.",4,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,We use this car seat for our 2 year old daughter and it seems to fit snuggley in any car we use it in. I love it and so does Emma.,5,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"Overall this has been a very good carseat.  I bought the Alpha Omega based on all the good reviews it got.  We bought it when my son was outgrowing his infant carrier carseat.  We did not have bad problems with the straps twisting like some of the reviewers claim.  It transitioned nicely from a rear-facing seat to a forward-facing carseat.  However it claims to last and that it can used as a booster seat with only the lap belt.  I was hoping to use this seat until my son was big enough for just the lap belt, then I would go out and get something like the TurboBooster.  My son is now 2 years old but only 25 pounds, so I can't use only the lapbelt.  The Alpha Omega (at least the one we own) has only one set of holes for the 5 point harness straps to come out, so they can not be adjusted anymore.  Since my son's shoulders are now above where those holes are, the straps constantly slide down off his shoulders.  We will have to go out and get a booster seat that has a 5 point harness.  It's a good, comfortable seat, but if you really want one to last, make sure there are at least 2 holes for the 5 point harness so that you can adjust it as your child grows taller.",4,1
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,I think this car seat is one of the best.  When we were looking to find a toddler car sear for our daughter we couldn't decide on this one or the Britax.  They were comparable in safety and features.  This one is so so easy to adjust for height and comfy.  She always falls asleep in it.  Not to mention the price was a lot better.  I do however wish that there was diffirent cool covers like what the britax has like leopard print.,5,1
La Petite Bebe 6 Piece Bedding Set,"I HAD NOT BOUGHT ANY NEW BEDDING WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND CHILD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT WE WERE HAVING.  I HAD LOOKED AT A FEW DIFFERENT STYLES OF BEDDING FOR EITHER BOY OR GIRL AND WAS REALLY HOPING I WOULD HAVE A GIRL SO I COULD USE THIS AWESOME LOOKING BEDDING.  IT IS REALLY """"GIRLY GIRL"""" AND FEATURES PRINCESS AND BALLET AND A LOT OF PINK.  AFTER HAVING MY GIRL I PURCHASED THE BEDDING WHICH IS SO CUTE AND I HAVE HAD A LOT OF COMMENTS ON.THE ONLY THING I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE SHEETS.  I ENDED UP GETTING THE SHEET THE SET COMES WITH AND 2 ADDITIONAL.  WITHIN THE FIRST FEW TIMES OF USING THEM THEY ALL HAD RIPPED BECAUSE THEY DON'T FIT THE CRIB MATTERESS CORRECTLY.  I WAS STILL ABLE TO USE THEM BECAUSE THE RIP WASN'T UP TO WEAR THE BABY SLEEPS - BUT AFTER SOME MORE WASHINGS AND USINGS I HAD TO THROW THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE REALLY BAD.",4,1
La Petite Bebe 6 Piece Bedding Set,"This being my first child and a girl, I really wanted to make her nursery a little girl's dream. When I saw this bedding set online I knew this was the one. Not only do you get the complete bedding set, including the dust ruffle, but you also get the window valance and the diaper stacker!!! What a deal for the price considering that most quality bedding sets only come with the comforter and sheets for the same price as the La Petite Bebe bedding. When the set arrived I was so excited, the bedding screams quality. You can see it everywhere, not just on first visual inspection but in the design and the construction! We also ordered the wall border, which matches perfectly with the bedding sets. Sometimes the border color and bedding colors vary slightly but these colors are an exact match!! My daughter is a dream come true and so is her nursery with the addition of La Petite Bebe bedding!!! I highly recommend this bedding set!",5,1
"Boppy Noggin NEST Head Support, Denim","It's nice to know that when our little one is riding in the car or swinging in his swing, his head is getting a little relief from all the pressure.",5,1
"Boppy Noggin NEST Head Support, Denim","I first heard about this product when researching plagiocephaly (head flattening) with my first son.  He had pretty severe torticollis which caused his head to become flat on one side.  By the time I found this product, his head shape was already getting a little bit better and we'd already had him to specialists who said it would probably correct itself on its own.My second son doesn't have torticollis but he does have a really noticable preference for turning his head to one side.  So I immediately bought a few more of these and have been using them everywhere .. in the car seat, swing, bouncy seat.  So far at three months, he doesn't seem to have any noticable flattening.  It's hard to say for sure if it's because of the noggin nest, but using them atleast helps me feel better when I have to keep in the car seat/swing, etc. for any amount of time.  The only thing I'd warn you about is that these aren't good at keeping their head from flopping forward or to one side when they're really really small.  I actually didn't use it in the car seat for the first few weeks because it seemed to make his head fall foward more.  Other than that, they're great.",4,1
"Boppy Noggin NEST Head Support, Denim",The first day I received this I used it. I noticed after only a few hours a difference. It has been 3 days now of using it everywhere except to put my son to sleep. His head is getting round again horray. The best thing ive gotton so far. I will be recommeding it to all of my expecting friends!!,5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,Overall I think this is a good teether - my baby seems to like it. The different colors catch his eye and he likes the different textures. When I first bought this he was only 4 months old and it was difficult for him to twist it but now that he's almost 9 months he has no trouble.,4,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,Bought this when my baby was about 5 months old and my 8 month old is still loving it.  Really started using it to its full potential and playing/moving it around about a month ago.,5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"The shapes this nifty little toy gets into... it fascinates even me, let alone my little boy! The different grooves on the different segments helps him establish a good grip even while he chews on it.",5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"I purchased this for my 6 month old Grandson and he just loves it. He has cut 2 teeth, so this has been a very welcome teether. Definitely am glad I purchased this item.",5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"This is a fun toy for babies as the sides move into different shapes.  The plastic surfaces have various textures for chewing and touching.  Simple, yet a great product.  I recommend it.",4,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"The greatest surprise we found when we got it was how twistable it was. I thought it was going to be just forming an 8 but it has so many different shapes then i find myself playing with it while my daughter plays with something else. It is very entertaining even for older kids.My 7 month old daughter likes it very much. it grew with her. We bought it when she was 4 month old and just liked to suck it, now she bangs it on the floor or the table. it is resistent, noisy enught and the rubber part is nice.",5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,My daughter really likes all the textures and colors. She also likes how she can move it. The only reason that it's not 5 stars is that it was a little stiff at first.,4,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"This toy is very cool and yet very simple. All the colors are individual piece connected together. Each color can be turned and twisted to make a new shape. Also, they are textured in places to give extra stimulation via touch. I give this toy two thumbs up.",4,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,I love this baby toy! It is very bright and pretty and very easy for a baby to grasp it!,5,1
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,Nice teether that serves double duty as a toy.  It twists and changes shapes which makes it a little more entertaining that other teethers we have.,5,1
Chicco: Caddy Stroller - Red,Great stroller for all types of travel.  It comes with a handy bag so that when it gets thrown around in the aircraft it stays clean.  I love that it has a 5 point harness rather than the graco city light which only has a lap belt.  Very light and easy to collapse.,4,1
Green Chambray Folding Hamper,"The hamper is terrific in that I never had a problem with the wood frame (other reviewers had) and the design is well thought out; having the mesh liner is a good idea.  Unfortunately, my hamper cover could not make it through the first wash.  I used cold water and delicate cycle and still the fabric ripped during the wash.  I don't mean along the seam where I could stitch it up easily either.  I was so disappointed.  It did shrink too.  I wasn't intending to put it in the dryer, just let it air dry on the frame.  The hamper isn't in a visible place so I still use it with just the frame and the mesh liner.",4,1
Green Chambray Folding Hamper,"I own 3 of these hampers! One for my 3 month olds room, one for my 2 1/2 year olds room, and now one for my and my husbands room! They are just so convinient!I too have lost socks, bibs, washcloths and such in the large plastic bins (they get lost on the bottom or something) and its nice to have our own laundry baskets. The mesh liner is very durable and holds about 4-5 days worth of each persons clothes (except for my husband and me, it holds about 2-3 days worth of our clothes lol). The mesh liner makes it so I can wash each persons clothes, and know what I have! All I do is ""collect"" each mesh bag and dump them all into a very large vinyl bag to bring it downstairs. This is much easier as opposed to those bulkey plastic bins that make it impossible to ""collect"" the laundry or to bring it downstairs. We keep the babies hampers in their large closets to prevent them from rumaging through them. The outside fabric is not getting dirty, so I dont see why you would wash it? But if you did I would recomend washing it in cold water (washing machine) and line drying it... This basket is also very nice looking as well!",5,1
Infantino Matching Colors and Textures Puzzles,Got this for granddaughter when she first turned 2 and she just wasn't that interested - so we put it away.  She's 2 1/2 now though so we got it back out and she LOVES it!  Its one of her favorite toys - its very durable and very educational.,5,1
Infantino Matching Colors and Textures Puzzles,"I like the number of patterns and colors it has, texture part is helpful too as it add new things whicj other color cards do not do.",5,1
Barn Yard - 6 Piece Set,"This pattern is adorable for a boy or girl!  The colors really catch a babies eye - our daughter loved to look at her bumper with all the animals and bright colors when she was a newborn.  We've since had to remove the bumper because she's 4 months but still loves her sheets, etc.  Words of advice...we registered for this at babiesrus but purchased many items from Burlington Coat Factory which was much cheaper.",5,1
Wonderworld Twist 'N' Roll,"I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my six month old daughter, but I let her play with it for a while before wrapping it.  She enjoyed it very much!  It seems to be of very good quality, the colors are brilliant, and is a nice size.",5,1
Wonderworld Twist 'N' Roll,"My 5 month old at the time loved this toy.  He is now almost 7 months old and has lost some interest;however, that's probably because he played with it so much.  It's a great tactile toy.",4,1
All Stars 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I received this as a gift for my son. Obviously because I don't see paying this amount for crib bedding. That's my only complaint, the price. I mean, they're going to pee, poop and spit up all over it and when they're done with it - it's done. With my daughter we had just a $50 set from Walmart. I was pleased with that. Everyone talked about how much nicer the quality is of these sets. I do agree that the quilt is really nice, and I like that everything is in the set together. It's absolutely perfect in his nursery, and I love it, My ties are on the top and bottom of the bumper, I remember reading someone said theirs didn't have them. I would have returned it! None the less, I love the set, i wouldn't have bought it myself solely on price, but it is very nice.",4,1
All Stars 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I was very happy with the crib set.  This particular theme was discontinued in the store and I had already put the borders up in the room.  I was very disappointed because I thought I might have to change the theme but to my surprise, I found it on amazon.  I was even more thrilled because I received it in 3 days and not the 22 days that was suggested.",5,1
All Stars 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"What can i say about the Set. Cute, practical and washes up easily. When we found  out we were having a boy and a girl. Me and my husband both agreed to do the boys room in a sports theme. This was the one. We looked at some at JcPennys, Kohls, and Target. They all seemed to be great quality. But i wanted a set that came with everything to match. This even has a table, clock, and shelf with pegs on it. After i got home from the baby shower i washed everything and hung the comforter out to dry on the line. Sometimes after you wash something it looks dull and worn. This still looked like brand new. I have no problems with the sheet slipping off the matress. I recieved 2 more fitted sheets to use as spares and then 2 more plain blue sheets from JcPennys. I washed them once and the colored faded right away. The room looks great with everything in place. My baby boy loves laying in his crib still at almost 6 months and staring up at his mobile. The fleece blanket that comes in this set is my sons fav blanket. After he was a month old i seen how much loved the blanket so i went out and bought another one. I wash my babys fav blankets once a week and it still looks like new. After 6 months!!! This is a great bedding set.",5,1

C.R. Gibson Noah's Ark Nursery Loose Leaf Baby Memory Book,"My daughter is 3 and a half now and I got this book when I was only a few months pregnant...I love it.  This book has everything a parent would want to remember and pass onto their child/children when they are older.  And this price is outstanding!

Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,"The reception of this monitor is excellent - we can hear the baby smack her lips as she starts to wake up - and having 2 receivers is VERY convenient.This monitor and others were sometimes given low marks due to problems with static.  We found that older portable phones can cause static when in use and that using certain outlets produced static.  So if you experience static, try different outlets and check the channel options on your portable phones.",4,1
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,We got this monitor for a shower gift (we did register for this one) and we love it.  It picks up every noise from our baby.  The clarity is excellent.  We have had no problems with static.,5,1
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,We live in a 2000sq ft. house and we have no problem with this monitor.  It has very clear reception throughout the whole house.  We highly recommend it!,5,1
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,"This is a great monitor.The clarity is exceptional. The price is great. However, you should plan on using the receivers with the 9-volt battery as it provides the clearest reception. The AC adapter did cause a lot of interference.",5,1
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,Absolutely love this monitor.  It is so sensitive to sound that we have it plugged in by our baby's window and when the neighbor's dog barks across the street I can hear it through the monitor and the red lights light up.  Have read other reviews complaining about static and if you set the monitor to the same channel as the monitors there should be no static.  Also love that the receiver is also a nightlight if you choose to touch it and turn it on.,5,1
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,"I have mixed feelings about the monitor. I use it all around the house and have not had any problems. I dont' get any static in the house around appliances, phones, TVs etc. But I do get some when I use my breast pump. I can still hear the baby through the static though. However, we have tried to use the monitor outside in our garage while we were in the hot tub. With the hot tub and TV on it was all static. All the red lights were lit up and you couldn't hear a thing besides static. Therefore we may be looking for a new monitor to use outside.",4,1
Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"Bought with first baby and attached it to bed. It could've been a little lower so I could look in without having to sit up in bed.  But we loved it, it was nice to have the baby close but not in the bed.  It has some pockets for extras like diapers but I didn't really use them.Now I have baby #2, and we used it again. Still love it, used the pockets this time. Wish they were deeper!  It's nice to be able to store extra bedding beneath the sleeper part too.  Good buy!",4,1
Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"This is better than a Bassinett for the following reasons - when you bring your newborn home... you want to keep an eye on the baby, every breath and noise your baby makes you want to be able to quickly look over to see whats going on. This co-sleeper makes that possible. I baught a bassinett first and the next day i made my husband get the co-sleeper. I was constantly sitting up (straining my fragile post-birth abs) throughout the night. It doesn't look as 'pretty and fluffy' as a bassinett but it is the best purchase. We use the bassinett during the day in the living room or when I am up and walking around anyway. But for sleeping at night this is the BEST. Porta crib sheets fit right onto it too. It doenst come with music or anything but your newborn doenst need that for quite a few weeks. It has great storage underneath it aswell.",5,1
Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"The Mini Co-Sleeper is my very favorite baby item.  Because I had a C-Section, it was very painful to have to get up and out of bed to nurse my daughter.  This solved that problem!  I love having my baby so close, and watching her fall asleep!  It truly is wonderful.  The only problem is that she is getting a little too big and I think I am going to buy the Original Co-Sleeper.  She is 3 months and I am hoping to keep her with us as long as I am still nursing her, 6 months or so.  So, one might consider getting the Original Co-Sleeper depending on how long they want their child to sleep with them.I LOVE the co-sleeper!",5,1
Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"This was the best baby item I've purchased.  My daughter has just turned 8 months old and we are still using it.  Now that she is sitting up and crawling, however, I can't put her to bed in the co-sleeper unless I am next to her.  I would never leave her in the co-sleeper unattended now that she is mobile because she could easily fall out of it .... or crawl onto my bed and fall off of that.  So, I bought a small sized (portable) wooden crib to put near the foot of my bed.  I put her down in the crib initially each night or whenever she is napping unattended.  Then when it's time for me to go to sleep, I just pick her up out of her crib and place her in the co-sleeper next to me.  She usually doesn't even wake up.  She LOVES sleeping next to Mommy, and when she looks over and smiles at me first thing in the morning it starts my day off just right!My only complaint is the flimsy ""mattress"" that comes with it.  Originally, I looked at Babies R Us for an upgraded mattress to fit inside the co-sleeper but they were all the wrong size.  So I went to a discount store and bought a firm twin-sized memory foam mattress for $20 and literally ""cut"" it down to fit inside the co-sleeper.  I placed the memory foam mattress on top of the flimsy one it comes with.  And underneath both of the mattresses, I placed a piece of particle board to provide a firm surface for her Angel Monitor (goes off if baby stops breathing...another must!)  So, I guess you could say our co-sleeper is a little ""rigged"" lol ... but it all works out and has been absolutely wonderful!  I plan on using it until she gets too long for it or outgrows the 23 lb weight limit (at 8 months she weighs 17 lbs).",4,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,My son is almost 1 and we had toys all over the living room until I purchased this toy box/organizer. We now have a neater living room and it is easy for my son to get toys out on his own. The removable tote that comes in the inside was great to carry his toys in when we recently drove to Florida.  I am sure he will enjoy the little town that folds down on the front when he is a bit older.  The best thing about this product is it much safer than a traditional wooden toy box.,5,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,"We got this toybox when my now going-on-three toddler was just a baby. He has played with it endlessly, slept in it, dumped it out, hauled it around, laid on it, and it's still going strong. It's impossible for him to injure himself (or anyone else!) with it, completely safe, AND he can't use it to climb on other things.It holds a ton of toys, and the extra bag has come in quite handy, too. (We have all his PotatoHead bits in it, stashed in the closet so he only makes THAT mess when we let him.)I am well-known for my sensitive nose, and never had the slightest problem with an odor.I would highly recommend this toybox; you will definitely get your money's worth and then some.Update: It survived two little boys and moved on to a new home!",5,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,This toy organizer has worked out perfectly for us. I love that it is soft so I know my daughter wont get hurt in any way. She has even enjoyed playing with the play mat. It's also great because it has a section which can be pulled out so we can bring some of the toys into a different room. Overall I think this was a great purchase.,4,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,"This box is really great.  I like the fact that there is an attached activity mat on the front as well as two compartments on the inside.  Plus, the storage tote on the inside makes it easy to travel with toys.  I would definitely recommend it.",5,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,When i ordered this product i didn't expect too much but i have to say i was very happy when it arrived. The colors are vibrant and i love the fact it is soft so no chance of pinching little fingers.,5,1
Ginny Fraser 11 Piece Jungle Nursery In A Box,"I purchased this as a gift for my pregnant daughter.  It was delivered promtly and in excellent shape.  She is thrilled with it, she says it is even more gorgeous and luxurious than the picture can say.  The nice thing is with the various colors, you can change the crib sheets and still have that ""together"" look.  She is having a little girl and finds just wonderful.",5,1
Ginny Fraser 11 Piece Jungle Nursery In A Box,"This is my fisrt baby and when searching bedding for the nusary I realized how picky I was.  When I saw this I fell in love with it.  I do not want to find out the sex of my baby and this was the only neutral bedding I found that I really loved.  I decided that if it did not become available before the baby was born I would wait to find the sex out to buy the bedding.  I was not about to settle with something else just because it was neutral.  Luckily I saw it was available and bought it right away I was afraid that if I waited for my shower it would become available again.  I am glad I didn't because four days later it did.  When it arrived, I saw why they could not keep it in stock.  Not only is it a great value, works great for either a boy or girl, but also it is quality.  It is so soft and very well made.  I cannot wait to get the room painted and get everything set up for the baby.  They never did email me to tell me it was in stock so I suggest you keep checking back and do not pass it up!",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",I received this as a shower gift. Living in North Dakota where winter temps get below zero a lot I was dreading having to bundle my baby in a bulky snowsuit. I have yet to put him in one. The Bundle Me keeps him warm and cozy. He doesn't like having anything touching his face so instead of pulling the top cover over his face we just throw a light blanket over the handle of the carseat to keep out the wind. We even used the Bundle Me on our trip to Southern California. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I plan to buy the Big Bundle me for next winter.PS. We were frustrated at first because the zipper kept getting stuck in the lining but we solved that by placing our finger in front of the zipper while zipping it to move any of the lining out of the way. Now it works perfect.,5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite","I just had twin girls and I live in Chicago.The weather is always up and down, so I want to make sure the girls have an option. Just the other morning it was extremely cold, but by the afternoon it was warm and sunny. In the morning I had them zipped up- in the afternoon I unzipped the BundleMe and let them enjoy the unusually warm weather. I can layer it more if I needed to, or leave it just the way it is. It is really soft, washable and the best present I have gotten for these girls! It also provides a nice surrounding cusion in a not so comfortable carrier. Sitting in traffic I know they are coomfortable and cozy. Most defenatly reccommended to anyone with infants!",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite","Being a new mom, I had been using blankets and worrying whether my baby was warm when we went out.  I observed other moms with this and went to Babies R Us and found it.  It is so easy to use and functional.  I live in a very cold area and this garment keeps my daughter very warm.  Sometimes when it is snowing I tuck a blanket around her as an extra precaution.  Regardless of whether I use the extra blanket her toes and fingers stay warm and she sleeps very soundly.  I highly recommend it.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite","I first purchased mine two years ago when my first son was two weeks old.  I had seen this product and thought it was too pricy; however, after two weeks of stuffing my little man into a snow suit I decided to try it.  I was sold immediately.  I know some people feel the baby still needs a jacket but I don't.  I live in NY where it can get quite cold and I only used the bundleme with a winter hat, never a coat.  If I was talking a walk with the baby which only happen a few times given the temperature outside, I put a blanket in the bundleme for some extra protection.  But if you are going from house to car, car to store, the Bundleme paired with a nice warm winter hat, is all that is needed.  I was sold the first time I used it.  Two months ago my second son was born and I am using the same Bundleme for him.  It has held up perfectly, even after being washed regularly.  I would never use a snowsuit on an infant again!!!",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",love it...started using it as soon as my daughter was born...she hated heavy clothing/sweaters and like... and this worked like a charm...,5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",This is a great buy for a colder climate.  We live up North and this definitely keeps our baby warm.  It is safe to use in the car...you can even detach the top part if you are on a longer trip and your baby gets to warm.  It is so much better than if you are just putting something over the car seat.  This lays right against your baby and we have been using it for over a month and he always feels nice and toasty warm in it.  All we will be using this winter is this and a hat for him...it has been working great.,5,1
The Ultimate Baby Wrap in Navy,"My baby is 6 weeks and I've been using this for 2-1/2 weeks.  It's been such a savior since my baby likes to be held ALL of the time.  My baby loves it and finds it very easy to fall asleep in it.  We even go out on long walks with our dog.  I've not had any problems with it sagging or stretching...but you do need to make sure you secure it properly and tight enough.  I'll admit the first couple of times I put it on I was ready to throw it across the room....but practice a few times with various ""tensions"" and ""tighnesses"" and you'll find the proper one for your baby.  It is very comfortable and does not bind or hurt your back.  Just this week my baby is starting to really discover the world around her and she loves to ride in it facing outward.  When she's sleepy she'll face inward.  When she's cranky, I swaddle her and wear it cradle style.  Every mother should own one of these!!!!",5,1
The Ultimate Baby Wrap in Navy,"The first day I got it - I was cooking mac & cheese while nursing my infant!!! This is the best baby sling - period. Once you get the hang of it - it's a breeze to put on - but it will take a few tries to get it routine. But between the verstility - carry front, back, foward facing, inward facing, on the hop, lying down - it's amazing. It's the ohly baby sling that holds the baby tight - close to you, so it is truly hands free - youdon't have to worry about baby slipping or falling out. I have 3 herniated discs in my back, and I can wear this baby sling all day long with no pain.  It's simply wonderful!",5,1
Summer Infant Fold-Up Infant Seat,"This is a great tool for moms who travel a lot. I used a standard bouncer with my first son and it was great. We used it for feeding and short-term entertainment - but mostly for feeding. My problem was the bouncer was really big and hard to take anywhere. I ended up using the infant car seat for everything when we went places.This chair is smaller than standard bouncers, folds up and fits in a travel bad (included) and works great for feeding! Now, when i go over to my family's house or go out to eat, I can carry this in on my shoulder, and set it up quickly.It doesn't ""bounce"" very hard like some of them do - but for me that's OK. It cost about 1/2 - 1/3 what other bouncers cost. I LOVE IT!!!",4,1
Crayola Floating Art Desk,"We've had our bathtub ""art desk"" for two years now and my now 4-year-old still likes it.  It does float but we usually leave it suction-cupped to the wall.  The surface cleans easily with just a washcloth and water.  My only complaint is that the two doors - hidden under the outside purple and red ""crayons"" are somewhat hard to open.  Not too hard though, just a little frustrating to tired little fingers at bath time.We have given these as gifts and would happily buy another if something ever happened to ours.",4,1
Snugli Front and Backpack Carrier,"easy to use,comfortable.I would recommend it to others,and would purchase again.when my daughter gets fussy i strap her on my back or chest.""she loves it""",5,1
Snugli Front and Backpack Carrier,I received the Snugli as a shower gift and it is a wonderful product.  I like that it is versatile and I will be able to use it not only for my newborn but as she gets older.  My baby likes to be snuggled so this is ideal. I carry her around and can get things done in the home.,5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"Honestly I can't recommend this mobile more highly.  It's very odd, but even the youngest baby is captivated by it.  The first time I bought one, I thought - ""what's the big deal, it's a little plastic hanging thing....""  Now I know.  I have three daughters and they have all LOVED it.  I now buy it as my standard ""newborn gift"".  But it with confidence!",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"my son can be crying, and when i put him in his bassinet with this mobile and he opens his eyes, it's like he sees an angel. he can watch it for literally 30 minutes at a time, talking to it...and the mobile hardly moves or does anything.i have an older son for whom we got an electric mobile in his infancy, and he hated it.  i thought i'd try this one under the premise that it's best not to overstimulate a newborn who was used to being in a womb...and i think it's right on.  it boggles my mind how much he loves this but he absolutely does!",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"We initially got a colorful, big, animal themed mobile, but our baby didn't seem to care for it too much. I think it was a bit too much for a newborn. Then I got this one and my 6 week old loves it. He loves the simple, contrasting colors and shapes and can stare at it for about 10 minutes at a time - pretty good for a baby:)",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"I bought this for my 7 week old baby boy.  I was skeptical, since it looked so cheap and didn't ""match"" any of the decor in the nursery.  But my baby loves it and will stare and smile at it for extended periods of time!  I love the fact that it comes with interchangeable pieces so I can change it up every week. It doesn't rotate or have music, but I actually like that I don't have to think about turning it on or keeping it going.  There is usually other music playing in the background anyway.  This has turned out to be one of my best baby purchases.",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"To buy this, I made 2 orders.1st order the product arrived with missing plastic parts so I can't put it together.2nd order the product arrived seems opened/used with extra graphic cards in it, which I decides to keep. So that is so so quality control.The plastics feels very cheap, it arrived with curved plastic hanger curved the wrong way, so I had to bent it back hoping I won't break it in half, and the graphic cards are just put together cheaply. It works for what it is, but I'm sure there can be better excution than this.So material wise, the $20 is definetely a ripoff...But it does work as intended for what it is, our 1 month old looks at it with great interest and concentration, so looks like it works as advertised.",4,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"I purchased this mobile for my baby for his first Christmas. OMGoodness! He absolutley loves this mobile. He immediatly gets happy and happily gazes for a long time at it. He talks to it too. You can just tell his little brain is going when he looks at the mobile. It just looks smart hanging on his crib. I love the fact you can change out the pictures as he gets older. It keeps him stimulated for sure. I can lay him down under it and take a shower, fold laundry, whatever I need to do. Definitely worth the money. Good price too!",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,Great item! Newborns really love the designs...they are not traditional but the black and white are favorites! Can't go wrong!,5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,I took so many pictures of her smiling at this. WE hung it in her crib and wonder if there's a market for a changing table pad with one of these attached somehow.,5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"Our grandson talks to this mobile, kicks and laughs. He's adorable. This is truly a stimulating mobile, not like the fancy, frilly playtoys. Preferable, in my opinion.",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,As a teacher I wanted something to stimulate my little one without flashing lights and music.  Just pure and simple.  Exactly what a baby wants and needs! As a Mom I wanted something my baby could enjoy and grow with.  This looked perfect and proved to be exactly that.  Every couple of months I change the cards and my baby falls in love with this all over again.  The product is also well made.  Very happy with this! And it was reasonably priced.  Seriously happy with this in every way shape and form!,5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"This mobile has been a great purchase even though it lacks the capability to rotate by itself. It was the first thing our baby really looked at and it has kept her amused for hours. The distinct geometrical figures seem to great for stimulating her and make her want to continue looking at them. The ability to switch the different parts out to change things up is also nice, although a bit difficult.",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"I am very happy with this purchase . The arm comes with this FYI to anyone wondering . It's very easy to assemble and I  like the different options of cards.  Great price , will recommend to family/friends. Beats paying $80 plus for a mobile .",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"I looked high and low for a mobile for my baby boy that didn't have lace and polka dots, footballs, and fruffy puppies on it. I didn't want anything too completely modern that was decorated more for preserving the parent's home decor than it is for fun time for the baby. I'm so glad I found this. I love that the pictures face towards the baby and are interchangeable.  It comes with links to adjust the height according to the baby's age and eyesight range. He really enjoys it and doesn't seem to get tired of it. I got a baby mobile music box on eBay for $10 and attached it. Perfect.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I don't have room for a highchair, so I bought this as my 8 month olds eating chair. It works great, he loves it and it's so easy to clean!",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"Very useful and handy product - I cant offer a single negative piece of feedback on this! The storage bag is nice, it wraps up tight and fits comfortably in the trunk. I like to place a chair under the seat after I attach it to the table for reassurance that it doesnt fall, but this is not required because the chair is very sturdy. We use this a few times a month while going out to eat, visiting friends, etc.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"This is a great product especially if you have limited space.  Excellent for an in-home daycare and the children love sitting at the table with everyone else as opposed to being separated in a high chair.  Easy to assemble, remove and clean for daily use.  Great product",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"As soon as my babies (twins) could sit up, we started using this seat.  I wasn't impressed with the idea of them sitting in the nasty restaurant high chairs.  I'm not a clean freak, but I've worked in that industry & not much thought goes into cleaning the chairs.First, I don't know what restaurants the other reviewers are going to, but we have not found one yet that has tables that this chair will not work on.  We've gone everywhere from McD to Outback with them without a table-fail.  We can use them at booths or normal tables (beware the booths...they give good foot-holds for the kids to stand up)  I usually put a chair slightly under the high chair, more to protect the babies' backs from passerbys than anything else.  I have no fear that this chair is going to crash to the floor.  They are so secure!!Second, the first of two problems I have found with this chair is that the chair doesn't have much support.  It really is a lot like putting the kid in a plastic bag.  So you need to insure the baby can sit up well on their own before trying to use this.  My daughter is a little small (19lbs at 19 months) and she used to be buried in the chair.  But she was so determined & excited to be sitting at the table with everyone else.The second problem is with the harness.  I have to use it, my daughter climbs on everything.  So I love that it's 5-point and not just 3-point.  But the straps get in the way every single time we put the kids in them.  Their feet get tangled up & we have to take additional time to un-tangle them.  The buckle on one of the chairs has broken but it's still functional.OH...I also recommend caring for them a little more gently than we have.  I just toss them in the stow-and-go compartments when we get back to the car.  This has resulted in one of the red release buttons to pop off.  Of course, we can't find it.  So now we have to use something pointy to get the arm to release once it's on the table.  But we take fault on that one.",4,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"This portable hook-on high chair is sturdy, strong and safe.  We feel very comfortable putting a wiggly 7 month old in this chair and not have to worry about them falling out.  In fact, this chair is made so well and works so well, we have bought 5 more for baby gifts. This chair is light weight, portable and certainly not in the way.  The design is wonderful and the safety features are great.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,The Easy Diner is so nice to take with you anywhere.It sometimes can be a little hard to fold up or I would have given it 5 stars. I just hope it lasts for a while.,4,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"Very easy to transport from one place to another.  Very secure for active two year olds too, and easy to clean",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I bought these because they had over body straps.  My girlfriends twins, both boys, were about 15 months old but very active.  They would not sit down at the table or their existing chairs.  They learned to climb out of normal leg straps and it did not stop them.  This made meal time impossible.  These chairs made it possible for them to sit at the table with us but also be strapped in.They are easy to clean and easy to put on the table.  My guess is some tables may not work well so I would check. However these worked perfectly for us.  Also the price was insanely low for how well these are made.  THey are listed as portable but I can tell you we use them daily and do not move often only for cleaning.Fast forward a year and we are still using them.  They learned how to get out of the straps but for the most part stay seated.  However I will say the abuse the two give these surprises me.  They have held up for almost a year now of constant abuse.  These days they even jumped in them (obviously stopped quickly and yelled at) and they stay attached.Basically, if your child or children are active and you are looking for a good seat these are it.  At $20 or less you cannot go wrong.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"We absolutely love this chair...especially for the price! It's very sturdy and doesn't even budge when I lean on it. We'll be leaving it in our trunk in the handy carry case it came in for trips to the grandparents, etc... Very very happy with our purchase! Our daughter loves sitting in it too!",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"Easy to adjust,safe,comfortable. Great for family gatherings at grandma's. Also portable for trips to eat out.Nice with pocket on back to store bibs,toys.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I can't believe how cheap this product is and yet so functional! It arrived flat packed and was so easy to assemble but came with instructions all the same. Very clever design - the brackets have little protective covers on the end and then you slide them into each other. There is even a little pocket on the back of the chair to store the carry bag, instructions and covers. This is the only hook on high chair I could find that would make it over the lip of my table (3&#34;) meaning you can use this just about anywhere. It is easy to clean with a Velcro insert.  The only issue is that my 8 month old is so small I have to put a hand towel under his butt to elevate his elbows above the bench but not an issue for older/bigger bubs.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I bought this to replace my greco high chair because it took up a lot of space. I knew I was going to use it mainly at the house and when we stay with relatives so the 2&#34; max was fine. My baby was 5 months old when we first started using it but I would recommend using it on a baby who can fully sit up (maybe 6 or 7 months) because there is no support. My baby is pretty average size and the chair puts his face just at the ledge of the table. He hasn't hit his face yet but it is probably going to happen. I just make sure not to put him in it when he's sleepy or mad. I don't think it is cheaply made or ugly, it's a high chair for under $20, it does what it is supposed to.",4,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,I highly recommend this chair. You can take it anywhere and it's SO strong! I practically stood on it and it wouldn't budge. I would get a second one to keep in the car but this thing is so easy to take off and put on that I can just grab it and go out.,5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"You get what you pay. Practical, okay quality, steady, safe, affordable. There are other hook-on chairs out there that are more expensive, but probably better quality. This chair however is perfect for us. Just what I was looking for. I was looking for something practical and affordable to use only for a few months while we are away from home. We have one chair similar to this back at home but of a better quality. I wanted something similar but I didn't want to pay too much. I am happy with the product. My baby likes it too! We can all sit and have dinner together around the table.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son, and he loves it (whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs).  It's a great size, easy to use, good color for hiding stains, and comfortable for him to sit in.  Best of all, because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag, we can be sure that he doesn't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat!This is an excellent product, and well worth the money.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Toddler Bundleme, Graphite, Toddler","I love this product.  I bought it for my 8 month old grandson it is so cuddlely and warm.  My daughter had been taking him out in a winter jacket and then having to take it off in the car because he was too uncomfortable with the jacket and seat belt.  She would then have to blast the heater to keep him warm.  Now she puts a hoodie on him, wraps him in a blaket to get out to the car and slips him in his bundle me.  It can easliy be transfered into his stooler if going to the mall or any other place you have to stroll the baby.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Navy","We purchaced our second Infant size BundleMe because our first one, lent to a friend and was thought to be returned, somehow never showed up again!  We received one for a gift for our first son.  We loved it and used it for the whole winter in his infant carrier and when he out grew that carrier, we used it in his Convertible seat.  The second one purchased for our second son was wonderful for our second son's infant carrier because he couldn't kick it off and we didn't have to add bulky clothes under his seat straps.  But when we moved him to his rear-facing convertible seat, the BundleMe didn't allow the straps to move as they tightened and loosened.  The velcro holes twisted the straps so we've quit using it for now.  We loved it for the infant seat though.",4,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Snow","Ever since we got the Bundleme there has always been one less blanket to cart around.  The only reason to bring one is if you need to take the baby out of the car seat where it's cold enough to need a blanket.  It has kept my daughter nice and warm wherever we have gone this winter, and I will continue to use it for the rest of the winter.One thing to consider, however, as the baby gets a little older, he/she might free his/her arms from the Bundleme, so a sweater might be advisable when the baby is old enough to figure out how to do this.",5,1
Learning Curve Lamaze - Bright Friends Dolphin,"I have Trotter the Pony for my 9 month old daughter (We got it when she was about 5 months) and since she loved it so much, we recently purchased this dolphin Lamaze toy.  I think the whole product line is great! They are interesting to look at and for such a small object, offer tons of entertainment. They make sounds, have different, colorful patterns all over, have plenty of parts for baby to chew on and all come with a easy hook on feature. I always keep one clipped to my diaper bag and/or my stroller toy bar.  My daughter still squeals with delight when she sees her old friends... can't wait to buy Celeste and the others too!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Complete Dishwasher Basket System,"Holds the bottle stuff pretty well, but not everything always gets clean because of the way you have to put things in.",4,1
"Safety 1st Designer Infant Car Seat Base, Black","does its job for my daughters travel system the Eddie Bauer Adventurer Sport Travel System, Michelle. It's a little hard to snap on but it's not because of this base it's because of the baby carrier seat because that same issue occures with the one already included in my sport travel system.",5,1
"Safety 1st Designer Infant Car Seat Base, Black",I was exhausting with switching car seat bases and this seat perfectly fits for the Safety 1st travel system  that I purchased at Target. I received it quickly and it snapped in perfectly for my husband's truck. This is a great buy!!,5,1
Sassy Firefly And Friends Bug Jar,"It's difficult to purchase toys for a baby since they're frequently only interested in the box in which the toy arrives!  This toy is reasonable and my daughter does enjoy the ""bugs"".  She's probably a little too young (9 mos) to appreciate putting the bugs into the bucket via the slots in the lid and she really doesn't ""catch"" the bugs using the included net.  But the bugs are a great size and fun shapes for little hands and mouths.  I like that they all have different textures and sounds (rattles).  The firefly is a nice addition, but it is sometimes difficult to get the light to come on (more strength needed than a baby has to whack it against something to trigger the light).Overall it was a decent purchase, but I think more toys should have just a half-step up in quality so that I wouldn't worry about the seams/rattly bits when washing them for baby.",4,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"This product is an excellent item to place the baby when you must do something else, but my son never lasted too long in it, even after he FINALLY figured out how to jump in it. Now that he knows how to ""jump"" in the jumpster, he is so heavy (Um...19 lbs?) that he almost touches the floor with his bottom side after the slightest jump. We live in a new house with standard 9 foot doorways. He has to jump in the closet or bathroom doorway! I don't recommend this if you have a heavy child, but they say not to put babies in these kinds of jumpers until they have excellent neck control anyway, by which time easily your child is close to 19 lbs...well maybe.",4,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"My son loves this jumper.  I wish I had purchased it sooner as he is 7 months old and big for his age.  He stays in it for long periods of time.  I can get all my chores done and he is still happy.  I bought the jumperoo first.  He might have stayed in it for 20 minutes, but didn't look exactly happy about it.  I liked the fact that you didn't need a doorway for the jumperoo, but it was way too bulky and took up way too much space.  I returned it and bought this jumper instead.  I cannot believe how happy he is now.  He spins and jumps and just has a lot more fun. This is a really great product but it does have one downside.  It's hard to adjust to the proper height and get it to stay that way. All in all, I would definately recommend this.",4,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,This is worth it. I haven't seen a baby who didn't love this. This will buy you enough time to take a shower (hang it in the doorway so you can supervise) or dinner with your family. Alternate this with an exersaucer for a nice change of pace.,5,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"Even though I loved this toy as a baby, we too almost returned it because of the not-so-obvious way to shorten the elastic jumper part which is suppose to accomodate taller/shorter babies.  (Our 5-month old baby is taller than most at her age).  So make sure to READ THE DIRECTIONS.Secondly, it is tough getting your child in and out of the seat, but that I feel that is a good/bad feature because at least you know its safe and that your child won't be jumping out of the seat themselves!Our little girl has not hurt herself (yet) by pinching her fingers against the doorway, although we have ours set up in a larger ""through-way"" rather than a regular doorway.I like it better than the stationary ""Jumperoo"" because it gives her more freedom to turn around and see everything, its much more portable and smaller in size (so you can it bring it to Grammys house), and its slightly less expensive. And most importantly, she loves it! So overall I would recommend this toy even with the two drawbacks mentioned.",4,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,This product is absolutely amazing and I've only owned it since this morning! But it has already kept my son completely occupied and happy...Granted hes 4 months old and anytime he can kick his legs he is happy.  He actually cried when his daddy took him out to change his diaper.  It is so entertaining to see him have so much fun with a huge smile on his face.  Its a must have!,5,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"I have this jumper, just in a different pattern. My son is going to be four months old soon and is VERY tiny. But he is a very active little boy and I knew he needed something fun to do. I didnt want to introduce an exersaucer until about 5 months because its too overstimulating. This jumper is very very nice. I keep his favorite blankets around him and he loves it. He cant bounce too well but he loves the position and if you bounce it for him. It fits in any doorway with a molding over head. It is very very easy to install (took about 25 minutes) and it is very easy to move. Even though it is easy to move, it is very stable. It will not fall and it can withstand even my 2 1/2 year old standing on the seat and ""swinging"". It is actually very easy to adjust (my friends daughter is 4 1/2 months and a BIG GIRL). My son loves to be in this and it was the perfect solution to my problem. I am also happy that when he does get an exersaucer, we will be able to ""rotate"" him from jumper to saucer. I cant see anything more you would want in a doorway bouncer, and it is much safer, more comfortable, LESS room, and more fun than the jumparoo!",5,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"This Jumpster was a wonderful addition to our baby registry.  We used this with our daughter everyday from the time she was about 5 months until she was too heavy for it.  I always felt she was very safe in it. It was a great alternative to the Jumparoo because it doesn't take up any floor space.  I will say that our door trim needed to be painted after we stopped using this due to the fact that the Jumpster would occasionally bump it when our daughter was jumping.  It didn't cause any damage though, just needed a little touch-up.",5,1
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,We have not had any trouble with these bottles leaking.  Thank goodness as these are the only bottles that my daughter seems to like.  Because of the larger nipples she was easily able to go from bottle to breast with no problem.  I have tried others and not found anything comparable in price or quality.,5,1
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"I was amazed at reading some of the poor reviews for the Avent bottles.  I purchased the Avent bottles for my first child because they attached so nicely with the breast pump and the bottles were good for storing in the freezer.  I was extremely pleased with them.  I never had a problem with leaking or gas.I did hear that some of the other nipples (size 2 and up) can give a faster flow of milk,  so I just stayed with the newborn size and never had any issues.Leaking was never a problem and to be honest,  I never even read the directions,  I just used common sense in assembling the top.",5,1
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"I like the Advent bottles and have a breastfed baby.  We've had no nipple confusion as alluded to by one of the previous reviewers, but we waited until she was 4 weeks old to start using a bottle.  As for leaking, if the cap isn't on properly, then yes, it will leak, but so will any bottle.  If there's any leaking, it comes from our daughter getting distracted and not sealing properly - not the bottles.  We love that these bottles came with the newborn pacifiers.  I think this is a great starter package and would make a great gift.My one and only disappointment is that although the set comes with the larger bottles for larger babies, the nipple sizes are a for 0-1 month.  True, we've been using them through three months, but it's time for the larger nipples and if you're including the larger bottles, why not the nipples that go with them?Philips Avent Medium Flow Nipple,Avent Fast Flow Silicone Nipple",4,1
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"When I first got these bottles they leaked.  I would prepare the bottle like I would any other.  I wasn't doing it right.  You have to read the instructions.  They say to wet the nipple, put the nipple through the calor, put the cap on, and then screw it on the bottle.  It makes some kind of vaccum seil and it works.",5,1
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"We've had these bottles for over a year, and have had no issues.  You have to pull the nipple through the white collar really well in order to not have it leak.  The people that are having issues probably are not pulling the nipple securely.",5,1
Jahgoo Baby Bath Support - White,"My son received this for Christmas when he was 12 months old.  He has loved it and played with it every day since (he is almost 2 now).  At first he only pushed it around.  The only problem was that he used to try to pick it up by the basket, and the basket would sometimes come off.  However, it is easy to put back on, and he outgrew that phase.  It can be used with or without the motion-activated music.  The music is cute and plays three different, and fairly short, tunes.  Also has volume control.  As he got older, he loved putting the blocks in the wheels and in the dump truck basket.  This toy has been one of his two favorite toys over the last year.",5,1
Jahgoo Baby Bath Support - White,"This is by far my son's favorite toy.  He has had this since he was six months old.  At first, he just enjoyed shaking and mouthing the blocks.  Now that he is 8 months old, he loves pushing it around and listening to the music.  He hasn't gotten the hang of putting the blocks into the wheels or filling and dumping the truck yet, but we look forward to seeing the progress.  I'm sure we'll get many more months out of this toy.",5,1
Especially for Baby Steam Sterilizer,I just bought this sterilizer and I think it's great. It doesn't take too long and it's VERY easy to use. The only problem is that I really don't like cleaning it. That part sucks but other than that it's great.,5,1
Baby Trend Double SnapNGo Navy,"I can't say enough about how much I love my snap and go - now that the twins are almost a year old and outgrowing thier infant car seats I am so sad to part with it.  I absolutely LOVED this thing!  I could fit almost a whole grocery run in the basket, it weighs WAY less than my big Graco duoglider, and it fits in the trunk of my Grand Am with plenty of room for groceries, etc.  If you are thinking about it - just buy it!  You will not regret it and it will save you time and space - things moms of twins are always short of!",5,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Fork And Spoon Flatware, Colors May Vary",I love these take and toss spoons. I keep them in my diaper bag. I'm such a hoarder though that I actually keep them and wash them in the dishwasher. They do great!,5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,My little boy came home at just 4 1/2 pounds and he loves this chair.  Its the only thing he'll sleep in.  He seems to like the vibration and music.  We've had no problems with the chair.I highly recommend.,5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"My chunky little one enjoyed hers for a while. It is beautiful, soft and looks unbelievably comfortable. (I just wish they made tem in my size.) They work lovely to sooth newborns and even has a soft blanket and toy.",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"Our baby has moderate to severe reflux and, as recommended, we are to keep him elevated for an hour after eating.  Because of this, the papasan has been so helpful with his napping after feedings since, unfortunately, we cannot sit and hold him that long after every bottle.He loves his papasan - it's so soft and cuddly.  We love it too and think it's one of the wisest purchase decisions that we've made so far.",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I registered for this item because it looked very ""comfy,"" and I am very glad I did.  My daughter was only 5 pounds when she was born, and this was the only item besides her bassinet that she could use.  At 2 1/2 months, she is still using it.  I love the portablility of it; I can put her in it whenever I need my hands free, and she is perfectly happy.Also, she has reflux and this seat keeps her upright enough to avoid any spitting up or other problems.  I would recommend it to anyone!",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"We purchased this while expecting, and were very glad we had it when our baby was a newborn.  He refused to sleep in his crib, either because it was big and scary, or because he couldn't comfortably lay flat.  He slept easily and soundly in the papasan, and we could fit the whole papasan in the crib to get him used to it.Pros:1. Comfy and holds baby at a good angle.2. No bright colors or distracting toys.3. Can be used from 7-15 pounds, at least.4. Vibrate setting is just right, and not annoyingly loud.5. Music is also not annoying.6. Cover removes easily for cleaning.Cons (and the reason I only gave this 4 stars):1. Batteries are hard to change, and the battery cover could easily have been designed differently.2. A steeper angle and a shallower angle would have been nice.This saved us from having to try to get a bassinet as well as a baby seat, and meant that baby could sleep wherever we were.",4,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"His my bed is my bed. He is now 1 month old today and when he is feeling especially cranky, he goes in the seat. His eyes get heavy and he drifts off to dreamland. Now I do sometimes pick up and end with one hand and bounce it a little. That usually gets him off to sleep.The extra padding is the reason I got this seat. I also have the Ocean Wonders seat, from my 1st baby. He really loved that seat, when he could enjoy it at about 3 months. His head would also flop to the side in that one because of the lack of the extra head cushion.My son is very satisfied with this seat. I believe this is a must have for all new babies, but remember that all babies are different. I have a friend, whose child didnot like theirs. I recommend with any purchase, especially if you are buying things before hand, which all of us do. Hang on to your receipt and if you can store your boxes, until you decide you want to keep your item.",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I got this swing for my baby shower and I absolutely love it!!!  When my daughter was collicy it was the only thing would calm her down and get her to fall asleep.  It was a life saver.  She is 6 months old now and I recently changed the direction it swings in and she loves it all over agian.  She loves the toys on it and she watches the birds, and butterfly move around.  She gets so excited she will laugh and kick her legs, she even fell asleep in it again.  It is very quiet, you can control the volume of the music, and the batteries last for a long time.  As often as I use it I have only had to change the batteries once.",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I love this chair.  It helps keep my baby asleep long enough for me to make myself lunch, which is a big deal for a baby that doesn't ever like to be put down.  My only complaint is that it doesn't bounce at all, which now that our son is born, we realize he likes.  But the vibrating feature is must.  I do wish it would stay on for a little longer.  My baby wimpers a little when it turns off.  It was defenately worth the money.",5,1
Fisher Price - Aquarium Take-along Swing,My 5 month old still LOVES this swing.  We've been using it since he was 3 weeks old.  When he was smaller he often fell asleep in it..he now likes to pull the toys and watch the lights.  I really don't understand the other negative reviews.  It really sounds like they are not using it properly.,5,1
Fisher Price - Aquarium Take-along Swing,"I started using the Oceans Wonders Swing when my daughter was about one week old. I did not use the lights much then but the music was great to help her fall asleep. My daughter is now five months old and she still loves her swing. She loves to bat at the hanging fish and has figured out how to start the music and lights by pulling them. She also loves to stare at the swimming fish that move as the swings moves back and forth.It is nice that it folds up for travel but it is not too easy to carry in the folded position. The seat flops around so you have to use two hands but other than that it is easy to travel with. I love that this is a nice compact swing and does not take up alot of space in the house, we have enough toys to take up room so size did matter when it came to this purchase.",4,1
Fisher Price - Aquarium Take-along Swing,"This is such a great invention.  It is so portable and lasts a long time on one set of batteries.  I would even recommend buying this as your main swing because it works just as well, but does not take up much space, whereas regular swings are so bulky.  You will be so happy you purchased this when you are on vacation or even just want to take the baby outside on the porch. LOVE it!!",5,1
Fisher Price - Aquarium Take-along Swing,"I don't know what other people are complaining about.  We have twin boys that were born 3 weeks premature.  They are 6 months now.  We used this swing from day one.  Their heads never fell over.  For the first few months we did put a head support in it, like the ones you put in a car seat.  We had a large swing with our first child and hated how much room it took up.  I also did not like it because as her legs were always hanging out of the swing and I was worried about this because of circulation.  I like how this swing supports the legs.  Our boys have slept in this swing very comfortably and I was not worried about their circulation to their legs because they are on the seat.  We love the fact that this folds so it is easy to put away and easy to take with us.  With twins we always need a place to put one of them and they have loved this from day one.  Our child care center got rid of their old large swings because of how much space they take up and also because of how their legs are always hanging out of the swing and replaced them with these swings.  They prefer the portability and the support for their legs also.",5,1
Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer,I have 4 month old twin girls and this bouncy seat has been the BEST item that I have purchased so far.  They have been using it since 3 weeks of age and love it.  The vibration and the wave sounds are very soothing and they usually prefer their naps in this seat rather than their beds.  They sit in here when we eat dinner and have just started cereal and are too small for their high chair so this seat does wonders.  I did have to return my original one(only one) and purchase a new one because I think there may have been a short in the vibration part.  But I still give it a 5!!  It goes with me on visits to friends or family.  Not collapsible but I love it so much that it finds a way into my car.  The cushion is also removable for easy washing.  I don't use the massager much but if you choose to it does turn off automatically.  BUY THIS CHAIR AND ENJOY A LITTLE QUIET TIME FOR YOURSELF TOO!!!!  YOUR LITTLE ONES WILL LOVE IT THAT MUCH!!!!,5,1
"Philips AVENT Magic Sport Spouts, 18+ Months","I use these to use with Pura stainless steel baby bottles. Putting the spout in is a tight fit, but it isn't going anywhere once it's in. I've never had one leak. They are very sturdy and made from hard plastic. I've been using them since my son was 11 months old because he destroys silicone spouts. These are indestructable (so far!) and seem like they will last for a long time. I've been using the same two for over six months and they show no sign of wear. You have to be careful not to misplace the small piece that goes under the spout and makes it spill proof, though. It's a small clear circle and would be really easy to lose in the dishwasher.",5,1
Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,"I am the mother of triplets.  This stroller is a lifesaver.  For those of you who want this for older children be prepared for it to be heavy because  you are putting 3 20+ pound kids in.  I handles nicely and once I learned how to fold it, there was no problem.  There are some complaints of it being to bit.  Well, it's a triplet stroller.  I love it, recomend it and its still going strong.",5,1
RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel Food Mill,Arrived on time as advertised.I used one of these to make potato dumplings one time.I have found these very useful.,5,1
Harmony High Chair - Colby,Have had this item for about 6 years. It was originally for my son but my 2 yr old has been using it also. The chair reclines so when the baby falls asleep while eating you just recline the chair and don't have to worry about waking them up when you lay them down.,5,1
Gossamer Wings Porta Crib Set,"I bought this set for my daughter for her daycare crib and it is adorable.  I like that the sheet was gingham, and though the description made it sound like it would be too satiny - it wasn't.  It's sweet without being too cutesy-girly.  And, you can match other color sheets with it.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Pink","If your baby is due in the fall or winter, you must get this.  It is so much easier than trying to wrap them in a blanket and buckle them into the car seat.  It is very easy to get into the car seat and once it's in, you don't need to mess with it again (except to zip your baby up!).  Since you don't have to bundle them up entirely, we used it until the weather got in the mid-60's and just didn't zip it up.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Pink",I received this as a baby shower gift that I had not registered for and it is the gift I use the most.  I absolutely love it!  I took the carseat with the Bundle Me to the Police Station to have the car seat checked and the police officer who was certified in carseat safety said the Bundle Me was safe to use because it does not interfere with the 5-point harness straps.  (Graco Snug Ride) I don't know if it would interfere with a 3-point harness. It is well woth the money.,5,1
Prince lionheart Ever-Fresh Replacement Pillow,The price is right and shipping is fast.  I love the product about as much as one can love a wipes warmer accessory.,5,1
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,This swing is perfect to take anywhere. It folds nicely and unfolds with ease. My baby is 15lbs and it works at all speeds. He loves to look in the mirror and play with the links. I recomend this swing to anyone who wants a travel swing or seat. I have found Fisher-Price has the best products........I only wish I knew before I had my baby!!:),5,1
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,"This swing is great because it takes up very little space and is very easy to fold away and set back up--mommy can even do it one- handed! (although Daddy can't...) Great bright colors for baby, speeds adjust for newborn to older infant.  The music is only as bad as any other child's toy--what are you gonna do?  It's nice that the toys come off for different combinations, too.  My 3 month old son is very active and has no problems whatsoever with this swing.",5,1
Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Microwave Sterlizer, not only is it a good value, but its fast and easy to use. I would definitely reccommend it to anyone with a new born.",5,1
Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"I love this idea. I just can't see putting your baby's bottles with the rest of your dishes in the dishwasher. If your plates are really greasy all that grease spreads before it starts washing and sometimes your dishes don't always come out spotless, why take the risk. This sterilizer is cheap and effective. It only takes a couple of minutes and it's done. Great job on this product!!!",5,1
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,"I, just like most of you other parents, struggled with my other children to find bathtubs that suit all of our needs to bathe our children, I always ended up bathing them in the sink in the end, but not with this bathtub. I really wanted it to try the little shower sprinkler thingy. I thought that at first it might be a bit too much for my twins, so I waited until they were about a month old to use it, but when I finally did.... OH BOY! My twins loved it !!! My son sits staring at the water flowing from the sprayer, and my daughter lets out the most adorable lil laugh. I'll admit the spray button is at an akward part of the sprayer, maybe it should be on the side, but all in all we loved this tub.",5,1
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,EXCELLENT!!! NEED I SAY MORE?I have a 2 yr old and 9 month.  I am home all week by myself as my husband travels.  I could not bath them if it wasn't for this seat.  IT is also secure and she doesn't feel restricted.  It appears comfortable and it keeps my preschooler from nocking her over.  It is so worth it!!,5,1
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"This is a very stable seat.  My 7 month old loves sitting in it and can lean forward and sideways to reach his tub toys without tipping over.  I usually bath my 2 year old at the same time and even when he """"helps"""" his little brother suds up he can't accidentally tip him over which did happen with other seats.",5,1
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"This bath seat was just great for our little one.  We used it from when he could sit up and are using it now (he is 11 months old).  It keeps them safe and sound, and makes bathing easier!  Highly recommend it!",5,1
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,We used this seat once our daughter got too big for the sink tub and used it till she could manage to get her way out of it.  It's kinda hard to wash your little ones bottom area though since they are sitting.  But it was a great item to have.,5,1
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"When I started shopping for a bath seat for my daughter, I read reviews on all the seats and decided to go with this one.  I was a little skeptical due to some bad reviews, but I am so glad that I bought this one.  She loves it!!  She was never very fond of taking a bath before, but since she has been able to sit in this seat, she loves her bath and doesn't want to get out.  She doesn't slide around and fall out and it is great for me too.  Getting her out can be a little tricky, but I have never scrathched or hurt her legs doing it.  We love this seat and would definitely reccomend it.  I wish that it wasn't quite so bulky and that you could store it easier, but it works great inspite of that.",4,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"Imagine the blessing of buying this as an &#34;open box&#34; item, at a pretty good discount. Oh yes - the box was not in great shape, and if it was the box I was interested in, I'd have been upset. There were a couple of places where the writing and the beautiful pictures on the box were marred, but readable... But the gate was in &#34;just from the box - brand new&#34; shape, and it's one of the easiest to use, most functional gates I've ever seen. Good thought and engineering went into this one, and I like it!Thanks Amazon, for making available discounted, good-as-new items, and thank you First Years, for a great product!",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"Our 3.5 year old has figured out how to open all other gates but this one!  Ha ha ha!!!It works well and has lasted for 3 years, so we just bought another one.",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"I really like this gate. It came with extra wall spacers in case you have thick trim, which was a bonus. Also, my dog loves seeing through the gate, and the gaps on the sides are small enough that he cannot get through or beneath (he is 5 lbs and can get through most gates). The only complaint I have is that when you have it pressure mounted on one side to an uneven wall (i.e. you have thick trim on the bottom and have unscrewed the top part to make it wider, as instructed), you have to occasionally tighten the extender so that the pressure against the wall is still there.",4,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,We put this gate up to keep our daughter from going up the stairs.  It is wonderful b/c it doesn't have holes in it for little feet to climb - it is very easy to use with one hand and so easy to clean!!  We have them mounted on our wall so they swing open and are very easy to detach and take with us to use as a pressure mount when we go somewhere where they don't have a baby but do have stairs.,5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"This gate is very easy to open and close, able to do so with one hand. Very easy to use when wall mounted. Pressure mounted works but is not at as fast to set up, not really a problem unless you are constantly going in and out of the room.Only con, the space between the wall and side with the handle. Not that big of a deal but if your child wants to climb over it, this will definitely help them.",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"These gates are very sturdy and they are very nice if you fasten them into your door frame. I have 3 little dogs and keep them out of the bedrooms in the daytime, these work perfect.",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"We used to use one to protect my daughter from a stairway when she was very young and it was perfect. Now, we're using it to keep a puppy confined to the kitchen during the times we're not home.It works splendidly, for both uses! We never fixed it to the wall although it does with all the proper hardware to do this. We found the tension fit was more than enough.",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,After going to pet stores in my local area I decided to look online. This product is great. Its for my shih tzu to keep him in the kitchen while I am gone. Its high enough so he can't jump over it and easy to put up and down. Also its not wood so he doesnt chew on it. Great value and great product!!!,5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,We purchased two of these to restrict our pets when needed. One we simply use as a tension gate in a doorway and the other we had installed at the top of a staircase. Installation was really easy and uncomplicated. Highly recommend.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We love love love our Healthy Care Booster Seat.++ We use it at home at our only dining table which is wonderful since we have a small place.  No extra chair needed for the little one and once the seat back is down we can push the chair under the table like any other chair.++ The blue tray is small enough to wash in the sink (as opposed to those massive highchair trays) and everything wipes down very very easily.++ It feels very safe once you secure the seat to the chair, buckle the baby in and click on the tray.  There's no way a baby houdini can wiggle out of this chair.++ Also it's easy to collapse and go to a friend's house which we've done many many times.  The lime tray cover keeps everything clean.  We can even fit her flexible plastic bib in the empty space between the seat and the tray.  The handle is handy for carrying too.++ The smaller size seems better suited for a baby than some of those gigantic highchairs.  I have a friend with a Peg Perego highchair and her poor baby is dwarfed in the thing.  The tray is practically at her baby's neck height, so her baby has to look forward (not down) to grab her food.  Also, since the tray is high, her baby keeps her hands in her lap which makes for extra messes on her clothes.  This booster fits so nicely on a baby and makes self-feeding much more natural.I only have one issue with this booster seat...-- I can't use the white tray that so many others have raved about.  The white tray is attached at the point nearest to the baby's belly, and my dumpling grabs the far part of the tray and pulls it up and snaps it off the blue tray.  Cheerios go flying into her lap and other places.  But this is a relatively minor issue because washing the blue tray is just as easy.  Now I only use the white tray for travelling because it is required to use the lime cover.I'd recommend this booster over a highchair... unless you want to wheel your baby around.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I recently bought this chair to replace my 1-year-old daughter's high chair.  I LOVE it.  I was pulling my hair out cleaning the high chair after every meal, this chair is so easy to clean and much more versatile.Pros:-Really easy to clean - no cracks for the food to slide into (ahhhh)-Chair attaches very securely to any chair with a back, the chair will not slide off, nice long straps in case you have a big chair-The tray is close enough to the baby that not too much food gets on their lap or on the seat (there are three different places you can attach the tray depending on your baby's size)-The tray is smaller than high-chair trays and fits easily in sink or dishwasher-You can pull the tray off completely and just pull baby up to the table (different heights in case your table is high/low - MAKE SURE you get the one with the three trays (labelled as blue, actually has a blue tray with a white tray on top and green tray cover), Amazon makes it look like one chair that comes in three colors but the red/yellow and green chairs have only 1 tray and no height adjustment)-Chair is light and folds up easily, easy to carry to restaurant to use as a booster, etc.-The price is right:  there is absolutely no reason to spend $100+ on a high chair with a nice cushy seat that you will have to dig food out of for the next 2 years; that you will have to roll around your kitchen/dining room to get it out of your way. This seat is comfy, versatile and folds up very nicely when you want it out of the way.Cons:  If you have a really big baby, this may not be the chair for you. My daughter is ~22 pounds and fits fine, but if you have a big baby, his belly might start to push up against the tray, it only goes out so far.******* UPDATE **********My daughter is now 2 and still uses this booster chair everyday.  And I still love it.  She has tested the limits of this chair - tried to pull of the tray, tried to lunge out of the chair while the waist strap was still fastened, tried to rock herself out of the chair, etc.  She is VERY secure in the chair, and it is no worse for all the abuse.  She is about average size and still fits just fine.  She now recognizes that this is her eating chair and taking it with us to restaurants makes dining with a todder a less miserable experience.  Especially since she can't climb out like she can from the restaurant high chairs.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We bought this because our grandson was visiting for Christmas. It was perfect. Easy to clean and transport. Well worth the investment.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Bought this for my nephew's visits and it works fine.  He seems comfortable and I feel confident in the attachment to my dining chair.  This may not be a long-term option because at 22-25 lbs he fits fine.  The tray is adjustable laterally but not vertically so I suppose he may grow out of it shortly.  Nice that it can be used as a regular booster at the table as well.  Great for the price!,4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Love this seat!  We actually do not own a regular high chair.  This little contraption attaches to any sturdy chair with a back.  It is super easy to wipe down since it has no fabric except on the nylon straps, which are not too difficult to wipe if needed.  It does come with a removable tray, but my son likes to lift it off, so we do not use it.  It works just fine without.  The food can go right on the tray without a plate.  Even without the top tray which is smaller and can be put in the dishwasher (bonus if your child will use it, which they might!) the bottom part is still easy to clean.I love that the whole thing folds down and can be easily brought to a restaurant.  Ever see most of the restaurant high chairs out there?  Gummed up food all over the place.  Most places seem to barely wipe them down, and as much as you may try, it is still pretty germy.  Chances are, your baby will also chew on the sides of them.  Also, you have to push them up to the table where they can knock over food, grab their plates, or pull at the tablecloth.  With the built in tray of this booster, no special accommodations need to be made.  Most restaurants have tables with regular chairs.  The tray adjusts to your growing baby, and the seat can even be used without the tray as a regular booster seat.  I love this thing!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We received this as a gift and it is probably the best item we received.  We live abroad and travel a great deal.  We take this with us everywhere.  It is lightweight and fits in the overhead bins of airplanes easily.  As soon as she was sitting on her own we started using this chair. Our little girl sits at the table with us everywhere now and loves being up at eye level with us while we eat.  When she is ready to eat the seat is perfect.  No highchair needed at our house!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",It was just what I was looking for.  It sits great on my chairs.  My granddaughter sits' nicely at the table and loves her new chair. I wish this was the first high chair I bought.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster SeatBought this on recommendation for occasional use by grandchildren in our house.  It is light weight and very compact.  Not all booster seats fold like this one and easily fit on a closet shelf.  Probably will have to purchase another one as we often have more than one grandchild over for dinner.  Definitely recommend.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My girl was very antsy sitting in the restaurant wooden chairs, and it seemed to be because she was sitting on hard wood, with a hard wooden back.  (actually, she was too small for the back to fit, so it was like stadium, backless seating for her).  This thing is great!  I've ordered a second one for Grandma's house.  It is small enough to take on the go, it is easy to use and clena, and she stays still in it for a LOT longer.... making restaurant meals much more pleasant for everyone around.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I have used this for both my kids.  LOVE IT!  Portable, sturdy and dishwasher safe (I think), at least I do it.  Only thing, it is hard to clean the straps.  Haven't figured that out well yet.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is a great seat and very functional.It is too small for my two years old, but, is nice, easy to carry and well built.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We purchased the booster seat for our 9-month grandaughter for her visits to our home.  The seat is everything is said it would be at a very affordable price.  It is easy to set up and take down to store.  It is easy to clean.  We like the fact that the tray can go in the dishwasher and be disinfected.  Plus if my daughter would need to travel with the baby, it folds up very conveniently and they could use it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Love this little seat,  we use it at the table for the boost and also for snacks in front of the TV, since it has the cool tray!  Our Granddaughter loves HER seat, she treats it like my husband does his recliner!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Product arived fully assembled and easy you use.  We bought it for our visiting grandson, who is almost one year old.  Worked out great for him in lieu of a actual high chair.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is really a deluxe, inexpensive little seat.  I really like how easy to clean it is.  There are choices for which way to use the tray, and a cover to keep it clean between uses.  Or, don't use the tray!  Pull the chair right up to the table so the child can sit with everyone else.  It makes feeding my granddaughter so easy.  It's also easy to take the tray off and unbuckle her.  Which I really appreciate when my arthritis is bad.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",My 18 month old grandsons love sitting in it. Easy to clean as well.It is easy to take on the road.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","It's fine, what can I say? Haven't used any other so no idea what the industry standard is. My only complaints are really minor, not deal breakers but enough to wish on a rating star for.Good news:It appears durable enough, we've been using it about a year now but only for travel, which we don't do all that often.The way it straps on to the back and bottom of a chair feels really secure.Easy to cleanI like that it includes a tray cover to keep the part they eat from clean when travelingWhat could be better:The ""boost"" doesn't go so high, could probably use a bit more height for short kids.The tray is kind of low when babies start to grow a bit, there's not a lot of space between the baby's thighs and the tray. My kid is even on the petite side. I realize part of the point of the booster is to raise the kid to reach the adult table, but sometimes you just don't want 'em there. But overall I imagine a heftier kid than mine would probably start to feel squished in this seat sooner than you'd want.The inner (white) tray snaps off MUCH too easily. I was looking forward to having it both as a spare and to be able to easily bring it to the sink to rinse off, but instead I rarely use it and it's just an extra piece in the way because from the very beginning my 1-year-old could easily pry it off and send food flying. No good.And this is not a problem with the product, in fact it's exactly as described, but I just think people should know this is NOT a full high chair replacement. That would be the excellent ""Space Saver"" booster which I'm about to review. But even though I didn't start my little one on table food until she was able to sit independently anyway, the seat of this booster was still not supportive enough for her at that point (I think she was about 9 months old when we first got this) - she was too little and wiggly and it just wasn't the same as high chair seats usually are more contoured. The tray is small too, which is perfect for travel and toddlers but not ideal for beginning eaters who don't yet understand how to keep their food in one place.Overall, this is an item that I'm very happy to have in my car trunk, but for home I'd probably get a more basic booster when my kid outgrows the high chair. The trays would be squashing her legs by that point and the boost isn't so high, I think most plainer seats would do the job very well or better for home. But for traveling with a baby to toddler, it's near perfect.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Omg! Great product great price. Our kitchen is to small for  high chair. This product is perfect.Well worth the money.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I am so glad I got this booster chair instead of a high chair.  It takes very little space and we always take it with us to my in-laws.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We already had one of these given to us by my wife's mom.  Since our eldest was about 9 months old, we have been using it.  It is great!  Very durable and easy to clean.  On top of that, it's great for travelling.  We take it with us whenever we go on a road trip; fits easily in the car and straps onto any chair we've tried so far.  We just got a second one for our youngest who is almost ready for it.  This is an absolute must if you take road trips with little ones and don't want to drag a highchair everywhere.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I wish that I had this chair when my other son was a baby. It makes my son more at ease to sit and eat at the table with us, doesn't take up any extra space and it's sturdy and holds up to the wrath of a baby :)",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",What a great little chair for our one year old grandchild.  Our children have this chair in their home and we bought one before an upcoming visit from grandbaby.  It's easy to use and so easy to clean.  Our old wooden high chair didn't have a safety strap as good as this and it was a pain to clean.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","EASIEST TO FOLD! I went to the store and tried folding all of the travel boosters.  After getting frustrated with the cheaper brands, I figured this one out with no instructions!  I have friends with the cheaper brands, but this one is worth the extra five dollars.CLEAN!  I absolutely love the tray cover!!!! What a great idea.  My friends' boosters do not have this.  My husband and I just returned home from a DC vacation.  Our son is 6 months old and he loves to lick everything in sight (and some things under the sofa:).  It was comforting to eat out with a clean surface for him to knaw!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My 6 1/2 month old granddaughter loves this chair.  Even when she's not eating, she loves to be up at the big table where she can see everyone.  The chair is very secure and appears to be very comfortable.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Bought this for my granddaughter. Love it because there's no fabric and the mess is easily wiped up. Nothing to wash after she eats. Lovelies I can push my chair in under the table with it attached. Fits perfectly.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I have an in home daycare.  I have tried several different boosters, and this is the best!  The best part is how easy to clean that it is.  Other boosters have cracks where food can build up.  They're a pain to take apart and clean.  But this one just requires an easy wipe down.  It's also easy to fold and carry with you.  I would definately recommend this booster seat!  I now have 3 of them.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","it is so handy. we use it evey day. it cleans up very easily. we don't use the insert tray like we thought we would, my daughter kept pulling it out. but still very happy with it. it's compact enough we take it also when we travel to families houses for weekend trips and whatnot.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I bought this because of the price compared to a full size High chair. I really love it. But i suggest covering your dining chair with a towel before installing the high chair because babies are very messy while eating.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Don't buy it thru Amazon.  I got it at Target for much cheaper.  Well worth it, however.  We have used it for a long time!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I have 3 of these, one at my sister's, one for the car and one for home. The only thing I didn't care for THIS one is that it doesn't have a hole in the back of the seat so you can use it as a handle. My other 2 which I had bought for my first son over 5 years ago has it.  I use these chairs for a long time! It made my older son stay put in restaurants!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",THIS WAS FOR MY GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER AND HAS AND STILL IS GOING A GREAT JOB.  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I hardly use the tray, but I do like that I can raise the seat up and down.  My kid loves it.  I wouldn't carry it around though, as it is bulky. Better than a high chair.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","When we started my son on jar food it was hard to handle him, the jar, the spoon and his roming hands.  Now it is so much easier to feed him. I love the fact that we can store it away when we are not using it, and my Sebastian loves sitting in it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My mom bought one of these to take the place of a high chair when we had 2 8-9 month olds and a 3 year old at her house for christmas.  It is so comfortable, easy to use, attractive, and so easy to clean, that there is now one in our house and my brother and sister in law's house as well!  I have used ours for our 1 yr old every single time we go to a restaurant, ever since he got sick in Feb with a very painful virus which the doctor said one could catch in any public place.  I've never been a panicky mom about cooties, but that was my limit.  With this chair, I can comfortable seat him at any restaurant and know he is safe and can both sit ina clean seat and eat his food off a clean tray.  I love that all parts of the tray go conveniently in the DW.  My son can be impatient, too, and both the seatbelt and the tray snapping on over his lap help keep him comfortably restrained. Not only do we use it for the little one in restaurants, but we use it for our almost-4 yr old to raise him to a comfortable height at our dining room table.  They are both big boys (90-95% in size), but both the 1 and 4 yr old fit comfortably.  It folds small enough that I can tuck it into my stroller basket to have on hand, and everyone loves how it all folds into a small package, with a convenient handle for carryign it.  Definitely a great thing to buy -- I would recommend it to a friend, or give it as a shower gift.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Pros: nice sturdy seat, plastic sections easy to clean. The colors are ok. protable. very handy. infants, toddlers find it comfortable. Cons: not sure how to clean the latches and fabric seat belts. not has cool looking as some of the other stylish items. Overall: good product. will use for baby number 3.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I bought this inexpensive chair for use at my parents' house and I wish this is the one I would have gotten for myself instead of the more expensive one I have. This chair is a great space saver, it's an awesome little high chair. LOVE it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This product is self explanatory, so no need for an extensive review. So I'll just mention a few things that I was pondering about prior to buying.1.) Does the tray swing with a hinge?No, you have to remove it completely, or use it. It basically clips in.2.) Can you adjust the height of the seat while your child is sitting on it?No, the adjustment is made on the underside. You'll have to flip the booster over to play with some latches. Very easy though.3.) Can you remove the back support?Yes.For $25, everything is acceptable. And we should have bought this sooner. We use our highchair in two different rooms in the house, one of which is the dining room. No need to lug the high chair around anymore.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Bought two of these for our church and love them.  The trays go through our commercial dishwasher and give peace of mind regarding sanitation for our little ones.  The seats fit securely on our padded chairs and put the little ones at just the right height to either eat from the tray or right up to the table.  Best of all, the seat itself is smooth and cleans up easily.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Bought two of these for twin grand babies. Easy to clean and use , only drawback is the twins are starting to get to big for any of their chairs.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We bought this chair when our son started on solids.  Every high chair we looked at was either flimsy, clunky, too hard to clean, or way too expensive - so we opted for this booster seat as a compromise.  If it didn't work as a high chair, at least we have a portable seat when we needed it and we're only out $25!  So far it's worked great!  Our son is 10 months old and this is still his only high chair.I love it because it's a great multi-tasker (Alton Brown would be so proud!)  Since it attaches to any chair with a back you can take it anywhere - restaurants, grandma's house.  And at home it doesn't take up half of your kitchen!  But don't forget that it's only as stable as the chair it's attached to!I only have one complaint and that's the removable tray.  Once your child figures out how to take it off - forget about it!  The front (closest to the child) is the only part that snaps on, so all they have to do is reach over and grab the opposing side and then the whole thing comes off!  But this is a pretty minor inconvenience - the rest of the tray is very easy to clean.  The top to ours is in a closet and I haven't missed it!Another tip - make sure to put something underneath the booster seat if you can.  A towel goes a long way toward keeping your chairs from getting completely covered in baby food!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","not having purchased a booster seat before, was impressed with the innovative features (removable tray, height adjustment) of the seat.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Love this chair. Started my 4 month old in it. He loves it. It's nice how it's adjustable w age so he'll be using it for many more months. Also, very durable and easy to clean. A def steal for the price. Buy it, you will enjoy.",5,1

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Have had no problems with this product. It comes apart easy and can be thrown in the dishwasher.  Easy to use & very durable.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We love this booster seat!  Our daughter is 8 months old, and we've been using it since her first experience with food around 4 months.  It's very convenient and easy to clean by tossing the tray in the dishwasher.  It's very secure when attached to our dining room chair, and if we have people over and need to use the chair for an adult it's easy to remove the seat and store it somewhere else.  We have also removed the seat and simply put it on the ground if we're eating in a different room of the house or someone else's house and it's a very safe way to keep her secure while she's eating.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I was searching for a booster for our table that would be suitable for a two year old. This one is perfect!!

When other parents are struggling with their toddlers at a restaurant, ours is happily playing and eating in her high chair, strapped in, with her own tray.  She loves it.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This really is perfect for home and travel to gram's house.  We take it everywhere.  Many restaurant's high chairs are not always clean enough.  It is easy to adjust the height and adjust the straps for any chair and table.  We haven't had one situation where we could use it.  Seat back folds down and has a handle and you can secure the seat table with the straps and everything stays tight during travel.  If you are limited on space, get this over a free standing child high chair.  We don't have a child high chair only this and don't regret it.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My grandson, 14 months, uses this chair daily. He is comfortable and safe in it. The cleanup is a breeze. The only problem we have had is that he learned within a week to lift the white insert out and watch the food fly everywhere. Now we only use the blue tray for feeding. Hopefully as he ages, this will cease to be a game and we can use the insert again. I especially like the idea of the of the lid to keep it clean or packed with snacks on a trip so it is restaurant ready.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",It's lightweight and portable. Didn't even have to read the instructions to figure out how to adjust anything. The best part about it is the three-piece tray. I love how it can be removed for cleaning and has a snap-on lid to make snacks/meals portable and easy to serve after baby is in the booster.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This product is great! It is great for taking to a friend or relative's house when there isn't a highchair available. It will attach to most any kitchen or dining room chair w/ a back! It sits upright very well and holds the baby in place good, it is very tight and secure if you tighten the straps right. It's great for taking on vacation or to a restaurant and it's dishwasher safe! The fact that you can fold it up and carry it w/ the strap is great too! Overall I gave it five stars for it's saftey, ease of use, comfort to baby, and it looks good too!",5,1

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I love this booster seat i actually purchased 2 of them one for myself to always keep in my car for family visits and one for at my kids grandmothers. I like the fact it is easy to clean with the smooth surfaces and snap off trays. It has height adjustments and takes little to no space. It works well to secure the child in to the seat to a normal kitchen chair you will find in most homes. I highly recomend it and use this as my go to baby shower gift also.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Should have bought this months ago. My 20 month old daughter loves to sit in it, she feels like she is part of the table conversation now, and it is helping her with her table manners. I love how small and compact it is.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",My wife and I have used this seat for our 15 month old son on several trips and have found it to be a solid product.  Setup is a snap and easily adapts to a variety of chairs.  The removable tray allows for easy clean up and the snap-on base tray holds securely when in use.  It folds into a relatively small size that easily fits on the floor in our back seat.  An overall solid product that seems like it will hold up to the use by multiple kids.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Very good, portable, easy to clean and sturdy booster seat. Our little boy is big for his age and felt instantly secure and comfy and I feel will have room to grow in this chair still. We bought this instead of a regular high chair so we could take it where ever we need and not spend quite so much money on something he won't use forever. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is a very sharp lip in the back side of the seat area near the child's feet. The outer edge is fine, but baby got the back of his heel caught under the lip of the seat and sliced once. We filed it down, but just an FYI. Otherwise it's awesome, love the trays and the portability. I would buy it again for sure.",4,1

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I'm a Navy mom and always on the go with my 10 month old daughter. I keep this feeding chair on the floor of my Ford Escape. I mostly take it to restaurants. Instead of waiting for a restaurant high chair that may be broken, occupied, or filthy, I use mine. You can use it with any size chair (that I have seen) or even in a booth. I use it in the car during road trips and day outings. When I go to a friends house, I bring it in with me. When I have play dates, I bring it in for a second high chair. If your baby dirties the table, you can put the lid on to protect your car from stains. Then you can clean it later. If you forget to clean the lid and need to use it again, you can remove all the lids and use just the base. It could not be easier or more convenient. I love this high chair and so far it was the best purchase I have made to make my mommy life easy!!!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","The straps that clip around and under the kitchen chair are really sturdy. The seat itself does not feel cheap, and it is easy to take the tray on and off. My daughter seems to fit in it perfectly even though she's really small.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is a great booster seat with a removable tray.  It also has a cupholder that snaps right on to the tray.  Because the tray can be unsnapped, you can use this as a booster seat for your older kids.  Cute colors, too.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This is pretty easy to use.  I strapped it to a chair when I got it and haven't taken it off since.  My 5 month old son can easily sit up in it (when he's strapped in) and the tray is easy to attach and remove.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We chose this booster seat to use as our ""high chair"" for feedings based on the positive reviews it received on Amazon and a limited amount of space available in our dining area. It is a decent choice for us; however, there are a couple of difficulties we've experienced with this seat.The first problem is that, at times, the tray doesn't snap on easily. One side will snap easily, then the other side can be difficult. With a squirmy or fussy baby, this can be frustrating. Not sure if it's a defect with our seat or if others have experienced this too. Luckily, after multiple attempts with position changes, it snaps and is very secure.Also, being slightly above average in height (6' and 5'7) and owning a standard-sized kitchen table and chairs, the booster seat sits so low that we have to slouch to feed the baby, or build up the base to raise the height for comfort. Neither are great options, so beware to taller parents!Besides these two issues, we find this seat a good value. It keeps the baby safe and secure, seems comfortable for the baby, is very easy to wipe down, is easily transportable to use at Grandma's house or at restaurants, and comes with dishwasher-safe divider tray with a cover. Also, for those of you without a lot of space or who just don't want a huge high chair sitting around, the booster chair slides easily under our table (while secured to the chair) when not being used. No one is aware it's there until we pull the chair out. (This is the positive side to the negative comment mentioned above.) Overall, a good product and value.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Easy to clean, easy to set up, and easy to adjust. What more could I ask for? I feel that it is very sturdy and even with a wiggly toddler, the seat does not budge once it is buckled onto the dining chair.I don't really use the top lid or the extra tray piece. Sometimes I don't even use the tray at all because I just push the chair up to the dining table. My 2 year old daughter does not complain. She even likes to climb onto this chair by herself and buckle herself in when she knows it is meal time. I also like it because it does not allow her to slouch down. She has to sit up straight. I wish I had bought this instead of her regular highchair.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Great seat. Easy to use / clean / adjust. Easily fits on the seat so the tray slides under a dining room table.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This has been a fantastic purchase for us. We've been using it for several months now and it's been great. We use it all the time when we're out. Our son is currently 11 months, and we choose to use this over the booster seat since it's much more sanitary and he wiggles around a lot less. We also use it to feed him outside by just placing it on the ground. It's cheap, durable and easy to clean. I can't see a need to use any other booster seat.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Not a high end highchair, but it does what we need. The only downside is that our little one figured out how to remove the tray, so we don't use it and just use the base tray instead. Which means that you can't put it in the dishwasher, but it's easy to clean in the sink. The other downside is that it's slightly difficult to clean the sides of the chair (our baby likes to put his hands everywhere!). But otherwise it is very versatile, easy to transport, easy to clean overall, and baby is comfortable inside!",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This could possibly be the best item I purchased for our baby to date.  We started using this seat when our daughter was 5 months and now she is 8 and we just love it.  I did alot of research on all of the baby items on our registry and boy am I glad.  We have a small apartment, so room for a full size highchair doesn't exist.  This seat is perfect.  Even if you do have room, this is still perfect.  It's so nice, durable and easy to clean.  We take it to restaurants with us, and it's not a hassle at all.  I almost feel proud for being such a great consumer.  People always ask us about the seat when we go out.  The carrying strap is so nice, it even has velcro to hold the strap in place so that it doesn't dangle.  My daughter absolutely loves it too.  You will feel the same way, I'm positive!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Update Jan 2010: After kiddo #2, I stand by my recommendation!  The ""fit"" on this seat is so much better than a giant high chair and they are terrific for travel and so very easy to clean.  I recommend it to anyone who asks about high chairs.**********************************We purchased this based on recommendations from other mothers when I was researching high chairs.  We started solids at six months and the fit was great.  The price is affordable -- much more so than most of the high chairs I was looking at -- and the booster travels *very* easily.  At the grandparents, we put it on the kitchen island and he loves being up at eye level with all the adults...try doing that with a regular high chair!Overall, this seat is really easy to clean.  The tray is easy to remove with one hand and shows no signs of stains even after having tomato sauce and blueberries rubbed all over it.  My only complaint is that the straps that hold the seat the the bottom of the chair do not remove for cleaning.  My little guy likes to grab/pull on the straps with his food-covered hands and it can be a bit of a pain to clean them well.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I love this seat!- It folds up nicely so that we can pop in in the car and take with when we go places-the straps can hook it to nearly any seat and are very easy to do and undo (For mom and dad)-EASY cleanup-You can use the tray or take it off and push baby up to the table to eat with the rest of the family (Great for that transition!)-My little one does arts and crafts in this chair and paints and mess wipe right off- three different height settings, I love that!-The middle tray that fits into the high chair tray is great for preparing dinner (I can put it right next to the other plates while I load them rather than having a huge bulky high chair tray all over my counter top)-my baby seems quite happy with itI wish I had purchased this in the beginning instead of a normal baby high chair.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I love this booster!It fits our average (maybe even smaller than average) sized kitchen chairs when other similar products did not.Easy to clean, easy to use, works perfectly, etc... Honestly, no complaints.I highly recommend it for anyone living in a small space. I also recommend it for anyone who is looking for a chair that will last a long time. I bought my first one when my baby was 6-months, just starting to sit at the table. She's now almost 3-years-old and still fits in it and it is in like-new condition. I purchased a second one for baby #2 and it's holding up just as well after 7 months of use.Great item! In fact, one of my Top 10 Must Have Kid Items!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Agree with all the positive reviews--this seat is awesome--it's compact (fits perfectly on a regular dining chair and is very easy to assemble/pack up), lightweight, and easy to clean (no fabric, yay!). The removable (dishwasher safe) tray makes it just that much easier to clean, which is a plus. Our large 8-month-old seems both comfortable and secure (hasn't found a way to escape yet). Plus you can't beat the price.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I like the fisher price full size version of this high chair. I actually returned our first one and went back and bought the fisher price healthy care highchair. I bought this and I love it. It had a removable tray that's great to put in the dishwasher and I also like the cover that goes on the tray to keep it clean. It has 3 height adjustments so it fits any table and has a 5 point restraint. The only thing I would like to see is a carrying strap because when you're trying to carry baby, diaper bag,and this chair...it gets tricky. I would still recommend this.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We use this chair for our 11 month old grandson. It straps onto our dining chairs very securely, seems comfortable for him, and doesn't look too bad either. We are very pleased with it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This Booster is so great for my 9 month old!  I keep it in the car, and use it at grandma's house.  He is comfortable, safe, and secure in it.  It has three adjustments for the tray (close or farther from his body) and height adjustments as well.  As he gets bigger, it can be pushed up to the table and used without the tray.  It is lightweight, and folds so it is easy to throw the strap over your shoulder and carry it in.  Lots of nice features on a very portable chair.  LOVE IT!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We use this at home and every time we go out to eat. It is fantastic and it holds up well. I can't say enough about this product. It is easy to clean and the try can go in the dishwasher. We have two of them, one stays in the car and the other one is in the house. We ditched our big high chair for this one.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I bought this product after having to return a similar product to Wallyworld because the safety straps were too short to fit around our 7 month old daughter.  For a few more dollars and no tax it came to us and has served it purpose wonderfully.  it's easy to use and baby finger friendly.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I purchased this for my granddaughter. It is one of the best gifts ever you cannot go wrong buying this product.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We had used this chair at my mom's house and fell in love with it. It saves a ton of space and makes it easy for our son to sit with us at the table. The trays and chair are super easy to clean. you do want to make sure that you have a very solid chair to attach it to (no flinsy swivel chairs or stools) and that you either put the tray on or tuck your child's legs under the edge of your table so s/he can't kick off the edge of the table and tip the chair over backwards. If the tray is on, my son can't reach to do this and if he's sitting with his legs tucked under the table with us, he doesn't even try.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We just purchase this chair in exchange for a defective chair from a different maker. My 9th month old son is very large for his age (he has literally spent much of his little life OFF the growth charts, in both size and wieght), as such his highchair is just not safe. Like the reviewer below my son very quickly (less then 1 minute) figured out how to remove the white tray top, and attempted to fling it across the room.  The removable tray top was a good idea that probably should have stayed an idea. Save your self some time and just leave it off. The chair is very light, and we plan to use it as a portable chair. Since its all hard plastic it is very easy to clean, just wipes off. The only thing to note was ours came with the belt strap installed incorrectly, but was simple to fix.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","My daughter absolutely loves this seat. I put it in the kitchen next to the ""adult"" table and she can participate and enjoy family dinners and have her own space, too. And I do not have to worry about her tipping or reaching for anything. I took it to our friends' place and also to the restaurant. It was very convenient. It's very light and easy to transport - it folds in seconds. I love that it can be strapped to any chair and it it can be cleaned very easily.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I have read tons of reviews before I chose this booster chair. Fortunately it was a good choice.My baby looks comfortable in this chair, it is easy to use and clean. She was almost 6 months old when we ordered her chair and it still makes me smile when I think about it how happy she was when she first tried it. :o)We do not use the little tray because she knows how take it off but I do not mind that.She is 28 inches tall and her weight is 20.5 lbs now and she still has plenty of room to grow.",5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White",It was hard to find a reasonably priced gate that's pressure mounted with a door that would also fit our wide hallway. This was just what we needed. It was easy to set up and has withstood our 1 year old son shaking it and hanging on it. He has gotten his arm/legs stuck in it but he does that in his crib too so I would not mark that as something wrong with the gate. Our 5 year old cannot get this open either so it works for older kids as well.,5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White",Just like in the store at 30% off!!!! This was a great find for the price! We installed it the same day and love it! Keeps baby out of trouble!,5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","This gate was purchased to keep our new puppy out of certain areas of the house.  The height is a definite asset and the self closing mechanism is great.  Other than the initial adjusting, I would rate this a 5 out of 5.",5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White",Bought this because infant gates are cheeper then Dog.  It works great and keeps my two big boys out of my bedroom while I still have easy access.,5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","we have 2 new puppies and wanted to contain them. the gate is tall and our dogs are small, so thought it might be a waste, but since it was one of the few that fit our door of 28"" and the price was good, we ordered. Loved the free shipping and no sales tax! gate is excellent quality and easy to install, plus if we want to move it to a wider door, it came w/extensions. It is white and matches our woodwork, so looks fine. highly recommended!Brenda HallOKC, OK",5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I have 7 dogs (not by my choice, but by inheritance). They are a Maltipoo, a Maltese, Dachshund mix, 45 lb. Lab mix, 75 lb. Pit/Lab mix and two Shepherd mix pups that are taller than any of the others. One of the pups seems to think the Maltese is a rabbit. Needless to say I have to keep them separated. This gate is the first one that I have found that is tall enough that they don't jump it. It is strong enough that they can't chew through it or push it over. I have also used it with our grandchildren. I can't begin to describe the security it brings. It's a life saver!",5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","The gate does it's intended job and, most of all, was very easy to install. I'd recommend to anyone who wants to 'contain' a toddler.",4,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","After pouring through Amazon reviews and scrutinizing the stock at Babies R Us, I finally picked this gate because it seemed to be the only one that truly did not need any fancy installation. It is great. It fits right in the bedroom doorway of our '50s house. We can open it with one hand, and it swings like a gate. All I had to do was take it out of the box, position it in the doorway, and turn the large screw type knobs with my hand until it was tightened in the doorway. Sort of like giant screw type earrings....Very easy and fast. They enclose a tool/wrench type thing you could use, but I used my hands and it worked out fine. I am going back to buy another for the other bedroom door. It opens like a gate, either way you swing it. You have to step over the bottom bar, but it is only a couple of inches and no problem, even for a klutz like me. I would highly recommend it!",5,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I did a lot of looking around before buying baby gates; our house has multiple wide openings that most gates do not fit.  However, this one worked well, without leaving marks on the wall/posts.  I love the tall height as well, since my daughter is over the 100 percentile for her height, and want something that she can't see over and figure out how to open.  Very easy to open for parents...the only downfall being a small part of the gate at the bottom you have to step over when going through, so you have to be careful not to trip.  Without spending tons of money, this is the most economical while serving it's purpose - safety.",4,1
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","This fits the bill for my 3 month old Golden Retriever, Jack.  I wanted a tall gate cause he's gonna be a big dog.  A great feature this gate has is a locking walk-thru gate.  I didn't want one you'd have to step over or take down every time you wanted to get into the area.  You have the option of screws to mount it or tension setting.  The tension setting works just fine.  I would recommend this product.",5,1
Black Diaper Bag,"I have tried MANY diaper bags over the course of my son's first year.  He is almost 14 months now and this diaper bag is absolutely perfect for him.  However, imagining having this bag during his first few months would be difficult.  In the beginning I carried A LOT!  Now his daily needs have downgraded to just a few items and this bag has worked best.  The bag is perfect for my toddlers needs and I also have room for my keys, wallet, lipstick, etc.  The cell phone carrier on the strap is a super great idea because I usually don't have time to dig for it in the bag while on the run.  It's a comfortable bag to wear for me, although it does get a little heavy when I've worn it for long periods of time.  My husband loves it also and he doesn't find the weight to be bothersome, even when I've jam packed it with all of our needs.  I bought this bag anticipating it will be well used on our upcoming trip to Disney World.  I believe I have made a wise purchase!",4,1
Black Diaper Bag,love this bag for everyday use. it doesnt hold enough for a weekend but it holds everything i need for for going out during the day. i like the two external pockets for my wallet/keys and the pocket on the strap for my cell phone. it rides comfortably across my body and is easy to carry when i've also got the baby to hold. i haven't had any wear issues or breakage issues either. i love that it doesn't look like a diaper bag.,4,1
"Badger Basket Natural Moses Basket with Hood, Pink Waffle Bedding","I bought this for a friend as a baby shower gift.  It is very cute, however, I would NOT recommend leaving a newborn in this.  The basket, hood, and handle was not sturdy and the padding on the bottom didn't seem safe and was very thin.  I rated this 4 stars because I think it would be great for a baby 3 or 4 months old.... SUPERVISED.  Basically an older baby that can support himself better.  It is also very cute!  And you cant beat the price!  I would recommend something more sturdy and better quality if you plan on using this a lot and when your baby is very young.",4,1
Fisher-Price: 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights Monitor,"This baby monitor has worked impeccably for us since the day we plugged it in. After reading reviews til my eyes blurred, I decided this was the place to start and, if need be, through trial and error, I'd find what best suited our home. Well, one trial is all it took. This monitor has provided us with crystal clear reception for four months now ... I can hear our baby's swooshing on his sheets as he moves about in his sleep!",5,1
Fisher-Price: 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights Monitor,"Este producto es muy &uacute;til y de buena calidad,  en pa&iacute;ses como Colombia, en algunos lugares presenta interferencias de se&ntilde;al por la mala calidad del energ&iacute;a electrica,  pero se puede solucionar con un buen cortapicos o estabilizador de voltaje",4,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"Although many reviews have been bad for this monitor, we got this as a shower gift and have found it to work perfectly.  There is zero static and it picks up my baby's every little sound.  I was actually amazed at how well it picked up his sounds.  However we live in a rural area, so maybe that has something to do with a clear signal/no static.  I would definitely recommend it for the price.",4,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I got this monitor after reading reviews in several forums and have been very happy with it. I was afraid it wouldn't work well because I live in a condo and we have 4 cordless phones, but we haven't had a single problem with reception.I've dropped the base several times (from a table onto carpet) and it's held up fine. The system also has good sensitivity - I stopped using it in my bedroom, which is right next to the nursery, b/c I was hearing everything and it was making me edgy.",5,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!",5,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,So what if there is a little fuzz when the monitor is turned up all the way!  It works perfectly and even picks up little birdies chirping outside.  It is a must have!  I can take a bath and know that I will be able to respond to her when she needs me.,5,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"After purchasing and looking at other monitors, we decided to keep this one.  The main reason is for the price I feel it is a good bargain.  The only problem that I have with it is that there is a low whine, but not annoying enough to hinder reception or sleep.  We have a 2-story house and with the dual receivers I can hear my son's every whimper any where in the house and outside.  I especially like the bonus of having the lights just in case there is other noise in the house, i.e. washer & dryer, dishwasher, etc.",5,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"We decided to buy this monitor. I really don't remember why, maybe the price. I think it was maybe $20.00 dollars when we bought it. Should of shopped around a little and spent more money.It does work pretty good. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has a lot of static if you turn it up to far. Other than that I like it and will continue to use it. Our daughter's room is right next to ours so we can keep the volume down really low and still be able to hear her at night.I would recommend this monitor if you don't mind hearing a lot of static. It does sound kind of scary at night ! I wouldn't recommend watching the movie White Noise while having one of these.",4,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I have used this product for several months now and love it! The monitors are very sensitive so I never have to worry about not being able to hear what is going on in my baby's room, but I also have the wonderful option of turning the sound down and just watching the lighted face if I need to. The dual monitors are also a must as I keep one upstairs and downstairs. Overall, this has been a great product!",5,1
Trend Lab Butterfly Shelf with Peg Hooks,"I love thsi shelf, my daughter displayed her pictures on the shelf and hangs her jackets on the pegs. I just wished it could fit a few more photos on top.",5,1
Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Musical Rocking Pony,"I bought this rocking horse for my daughter on her first birthday.  As soon as I put it together (which is a piece of cake), she was interested.  She gets on and off it throughout everyday.  She first just climbed on it, now realizes it rocks with her motion and loves to rock on it and have it sing to her.  She always has that ""look at me"" smirk on her face when she gets on it.  I'd recommend to anyone.",4,1
Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Musical Rocking Pony,"Bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and she loves it!  All I have to do is ""sing"" the lone ranger theme song and she runs over to it, gets on all by herself and rocks and laughs.  It took her about a week to realize she can rock it herself, and now she is so proud of herself!  Stickers were a bit of a pain, but the directions were pretty clear.  Just put it together when baby is not around to give yourself a few minutes to figure out the chart!  I had no problems at all that way.",4,1
Trend Lab Butterfly Wall Clock,"Exactly what I was looking for!! So stinkin cute, goes with everything in my kitchen perfectly, couldn't be more happy with this product.",5,1
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Navy","This is a great way to add shade.  Especially since my jogger, which was handed down to me, has a very small shade.  This adds the perfect amount.  Its also stretchy which makes it cover even more areas.  Only concern I have is the straps aren't so stretchy, and I tend to pull a little to much omly to make sure little feet are covered.  I may have to reinforece them with a little sewing.  Overall its done what I needed it too.",4,1
Kidco Gateway To Go Portable Pressure Gate,"I agree with the other reviewers who said this is not a great travel gate.  It does not fold up quickly or easily.  You have to have some practice to know how to fold it up quickly.  On the other hand, it makes a great, soft gate to keep across doorways where you want children or pets to stay in or out of.  I keep this gate in the hallway and put it up across our nursery doorway when it's naptime so I can keep our dog out but allow the nursery door to stay slightly open.  I also use it to keep my toddler in his child-proofed room when I shower or at night when he gets out of bed to keep him from wandering around the house.  For these purposes, the gate is fantastic.",4,1
Gossamer Wings 3 Piece Clothes Peg Set,"I love this peg set! I actually used them to hang the wall hangings from, they look adorable together and each peg matched one of the wall hangings.  They were a little difficult to hang but are very sturdy. They look great together or apart.",5,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"The rails in the banister on the 2nd level of our home has rails that are wide enough for our 1 year old son to fit his whole body through.  Our first reaction was to get the banister replaced.  However, my husband discussed it with a lady at work and she suggested a similar product to this one but it was made of net.  I did some research and found this item on Amazon.  After reading the reviews I thought this item will serve the purpose.  It worked out really well for us.  The only thing is that my son now loves to bang on it and it makes a very loud noise, so if you can tolerate that it should work out fine.  It is clear which I love because it is not that noticeable.  Overall I am completely satisfied!",5,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"This product has made me feel better when my baby goes near the bannister. He can't go through it and that's what I was worried about. Installation was no fun, but once it was up, I was happy with it.",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"I got this item so that my small dogs can't go through the second story banister of my staircase.  Originally I was a little concerned that the plastic would look tacky, but I am glad I decided to try it.  This product was reasonable, and looked as good as any other option that was out there for the purpose. You see that it is plastic if you look at it and see the shine, but it is better than having an option such as mesh (my previous, temporary solution).  It took people to install it: one holding the roll tight, and the other person using hole punch and zip tying the plastic.  The roll was too long, so we had to cut the plastic, which was a little struggle to cut straight. Overall I am very satisfied.",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"We bought the banister guard to cover the railings of the banister next to our basement stairs.  The rails are about 6 inches apart so we needed to cover them for our 1 year old daughter who's always on the move, as well as our two mini-dachshunds.The guard was easy to install.  It comes with ties and you can drill through the plastic to place the ties wherever you want them.  It's as simple as that!You'll want to pull it as tight as you can though or else it isn't very attractive.  Ours could be a little tighter to smooth it out a bit but the important thing is that it is sturdy and does its job.Our daughter has been leaning on it and standing up against it and it is very secure.  We are happy with the purchase.",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"We bought this to protect our 18 month old from running through our banister.  Unfortunately our spindals are too far apart from each other, making it possible for her to fall down a flight of stairs if she wasn't careful.I was eager to put it up, so I didn't wait for husband to get home to help.  It took me a good 2.5 hours to put it up.  It was too wide for our railing, so I had to cut it to make it fit.  I used my rotary cutter used for fabric to cut through the plastic, which worked great.My husband was worried that it would look cheap and he actually doesn't mind it. And I personally don't mind it either, I actually barley notice it anymore.  I'd rather pay $35 for this plastic than redo our banister. My only complaint is that it's annoying to clean off.  The side that faces you is easy to clean, the other side however is tricky.  Since it is plastic, you can see finger prints and smudges pretty easily.If you are looking for an inexpensive fix, this is what you are looking for.  I don't worry about my child's safety concerning our staircase anymore.  She isn't able to push through it, so it perfect for right now!",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"We were initially surprised to see ""just"" a clear thick plastic sheet and a punch and some ties in the package. I don't know if fabric stores sell thick clear sheets but it looked like we could get these stuff for a lot less . But with a baby around since we don't have much time to do all the exploring before buying, this is  a better option.Its little hard to install on the railings of the stairs. We installed it on the top balcony and it is serving the purpose.",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"I'm happy with this guard, I like that it is clear plastic so it's not that noticable and wipes off easily.  So far it's proved to be very durable and it keeps my daughter from even trying to climb through the rails.  It was fairly easy to install with 2 people.",5,1
SafeFit Baby In Sight,"I bought this mirror because it has a larger mirror area than other ones.  Sure, it doesn't have the colorful and fun designs, but to my daughter just seeing her reflexion is entertainment enough.  It installed easily and adjusts easily.  However, it does come loose occasionally, which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.  It is so soft and lightweight that times it has come loose and landed on my daughter she isn't fazed, and she just starts playing with it.  I am very happy with our decision to buy this mirror.",4,1
The First Years: Clear and Near 2.4 GHz Monitor,"Wow!  This product was pricey but the difference was amazing.  This product not only gets chrystal clear reception, it amplifies as well.  I put the receiver eight feet away from my daughter and can still hear her breathing. This is very reassuring, especially when she is sick.  After returning six different monitors, this has been the perfect monitor for her grandparent's home because the house is simply too large for the 900 Mhz models.  Note:  Neither my in-laws nor my house has a 2.4 GHz telephone or equipment that apparently interferes with the reception.",5,1
The First Years: Clear and Near 2.4 GHz Monitor,We loved this monitor so much. Used it for 4 or 5 yrs and still works great. Good quality sound even at long range which was a must for us while working in the yard during nap time. Tried two other brands before we found this one and were happy we did.,5,1
The First Years: Clear and Near 2.4 GHz Monitor,"Wow, I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews on the First Years Clear and Near 2.4 Ghz Monitor, just for the simple fact that it works wonderfully! I received a really nice monitor set for my child as a gift and the static was just awful. So, I went out and bought what I thought would be the best monitor I could. I ended up bringing home the Clear and Near set and I have been really pleased with the results.I have been using this monitor for two weeks now with absolutely no problems, and I live right under the flight path for an airport! Even with the planes flighing over, the signal never gets garbled, and I can hear my daughter clear as day.As for range, I have a garage that is not attached to my home that I go out to, and I still have no problem hearing my child. Also, the monitor comes with a belt clip, so if you need to do any yard work you are all set!The only thing I would change about the First Years Clear and Near Monitor is the fact that it only comes with one receiver, or parent unit, I wish that I cold get one more so that I could have one in the kitchen and in the living room. But that is truely my only gripe with this set! Sure, it is a little pricey, but it is worth it!",5,1
Peg Perego Pliko P-3 Classico Stroller - Chesapeake,"I had to write a review.  We did a lot of research before getting the pliko stroller and car seat system .  We've been using the P3 now for over a month and have been very pleased with the performance of this unit.  I am an aerospace engineer with over 10 years in jet engine mechanical design so I hope I can lend a little credibility to this review.  The bottom line is that stroller is extremely well designed and good looking and well worth the money.  The only bad experience we had was from our families and friends who couldn't believe we spent so much on a stroller and pretty much openly ridculed us.  I know they're just jealous because this stroller is so nice (ha ha).  First, relative to the car seat.  There were several complaints that the car seat was too small and that the baby would quickly grow compared to a Graco.  I measured the key dimensions of the Peg and Graco car seats.  The dimensions of the plastic shell were the same, but the Peg had a 3/4"" foam padding that the Graco does not giving the appearance of a tighter fit.  I'm sure both Graco and Peg designers work to the same anthropometric data for babies.  We felt that the padding would make a better cushion for a new born baby and could be removed as the baby grows.  We actually felt sorry for the little baby that would have to ride in the uncoushined Graco car seat.The prime decision factor for the stroller was the more compact size.  We both have small 4 door sedans and no plans for a minivan or SUV.  We compared several models in our trunks and the P3 gave us so much more room.  The other side benefits of the P3 were the maneuvering capability, independent side handles for bag carrying and of course the look and construction.  We did a side by side comparison of several Graco's and the P3 around the babies r us store and found the P3 to be by far the easiest to maneuver one-handed.  The fit and finish of the Graco combined with the different rake angle of the front castering wheels caused the wheels to lock up at which point you have to jockey your position to correct.  The P3 handled like a dream.  A complaint we saw repeated in other reviews with the P3 was the small carrying capacity of the underside pouch.  It is small due to the umbrella design of the stroller, but what we have found was the the independent handles inherent to the design of an umbrella stroller like the P3 allows you to place your shopping bags over the handles and carry way more than a Graco pouch could hold.  This would not be possible with a wrap around handle found on the Graco's.  Also, the drink holders are a little small, but we have found to be satisfactory for our needs.  I'm not going to go into detail about the look and contruction of the Pliko's.  You have to see and feel for yourself at a store.In closing, the price is a lot for these units, but well worth it, in my opinion.  I am the type of purchaser that likes to buy something nice once and will pay more for higher quality and buy less of it.  My sister has been through 3 Graco's in the past 5 years because of mechanical problems.  I don't foresee the P3 breaking as easily.  Even if the equivalent Graco model never broke, the extra money over the 2+ years of ownership is not too big of deal in my opinion.",5,1
Twin Swift Stroller -Navy w/ Mesh Basket,"I love this double stroller for many reasons. My 9 month olds are very squirmy, but I couldnt stand the SUV double that we owned before... I love the swift.At BRU we test drove a few strollers (after returning our borowed DuoGlider to the original owner... more of a sigh of relief than a sigh of anger!)Well we tried the DuoRider... This stroller was completely inferior to any double I had ever laid eyes on! The straps were flimsy lapbelts, there was minimal storage, only ONE canopy to cover both children (plus I cant imagine an average 3 year old fitting in it) it was too large, yet the seats were too cramped. The wheels were flimsy and squeaky, it was just horrible.I saw the double Jeep stroller, it was definatly an umbrella stroller. It was just TOO umbrella like, and it was too ""unsafe"" for the twins...So we laid eyes on the Swift. It was the double umbrella with a few bonuses that we were looking for.Its sturdy, that means the wheels wont spontaniously fall off like on the DuoGlider. I loved how easy it was to steer and manuver, and that it was very easy to turn as well. I absolutly LOVED that it could fold easily, but DEFINATLY not with one hand. It folds pretty small, and can fit well into the trunk of my minivan. I also love that the stroller is ""lightweight"", at 28 lbs... thats not too heavy, but not really too lightweight either. Theres 5 point harnesses for them, this was a big deciding factor on the swift, and they are well padded and secure. The seats reqline (another feature that we needed) and they reqline FULLY and sit up FULLY. The seats are easy to take off and wash, and equally easy to wipe up. They are comfortable, and definatly not the kind of material that makes children swet 5 liters! the handles are high enough for my husband, but also easy for me to hold as well. I love that they can hold bags on them also, this is ideal since the storage is minimal. We can fit a thin diaperbag in one (with diapers, wipes, powders, bottles, onesies, and two thin blankets) I also found that in the other basket I can fit children jackets, and a small purse for me. I purchased an add on stroller accesory kit which came with a drink holder for us, a snack cup for the kids, and a compartment for keys and a cellphone... Thats the only thing that we dont like about the stroller is the lack of cupholders and accessory holders for everyone. I love this stroller, since it fits through most doorways, and since its great outdoors and indoors. Great at parks, airports, malls, zoos, aquariums, beaches, up hills, and ""off road"".I think we will have this stroller for atleast a few more years, its sturdy, reliable, and much simpler than the extravegant (and inferior) graco models... yet perfect for babies as well as toddlers.",5,1

I love the options of BM storage.Overall I would recommend this pump to anyone. I can pump 1oz per side more than the hospital grade Lactina !!!!Did I mention I love this pump!!!! I just wish the replacement valves and tubing, extra pumping bottles were widely available instead of having to order through the Playtex.",5,1
Playtex Embrace Breast Pump System,bought this pump when i was pregnant with my daughter 3 yrs ago. i then let my sister borrow it with her son and i now have it back for my 2nd daughter and it is still goin strong. when i got it back from my sister i called to order replacment cups and playtex overnighted them to me free of chargh. well worth the money.,5,1
Playtex Embrace Breast Pump System,"As a new mom to twins I knew I would be needing a breast pump to help keep up my milk supply & also so I could get help with other people doing some feedings.  I was a little cautious about buying the Playtex Embrace pump as it was new & didn't have a lot of reviews.  But after reading the other reviews that were available I decided to bite the bullet & buy it.I am so glad I made this smart purchase decision.  It is easy to use, not very loud, & doesn't hurt when I use it.  I am using the playtex drop in liner bottle system, so this also works great with that bottle system.  I can just pump straight into a liner & plop it into a bottle with a nipple, or refrigerate/freeze for later use.  The bag it comes in is really stylish & cute too, definitely wouldn't know you're carrying all your breast pump supplies around!So two thumbs up from me!",5,1
Playtex Embrace Breast Pump System,"I'd never used a pump before and was worried about it hurting. I don't have anything to compare it to, but this one doesn't hurt at all.  It's easy to use and quick.  I would definately recommend it.",5,1
Playtex VentAire Wide (NaturalShape) Silicone Nipples - Fast Flow - 2 Pack,I've used the wide bottles for each of my 3 kids as it most closely resembles the breast. I've had no issues with leaking from the bottles and the nipples a well constructed and take quite a bit of abuse. My kids prefer the fast flow pretty quickly so we stock on these early on.,4,1
"Playtex VentAire Advanced Wide Natural Shape Slow-Flow Nipples, 2 Count",I purchased a 3 pack of the vent air bottles from my local store and i didnt notice they were 3-6 month nipples so i went back to purchase the correct nipples and they didnt stock them. So i came on here and ordered these with no complaints factory sealed genuine product at a great price.,5,1
"Playtex VentAire Advanced Wide Natural Shape Slow-Flow Nipples, 2 Count","The bottles come with the fast flow nipples but using the slowest flow your baby will tolerate is best so your baby can more easily gauge when the are full instead of just guzzling it down. This is a skill that's very useful later in life to help prevent obesity (eating slowly so your body can tell you it's full before you over eat). Additionally, breastfeed babies do better with slow flow as they're used to on trolling the flow of milk and this is an easier transition for them.",5,1
Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain Carrier - Silver/Charcoal,"This backpack was everything everyone said it would be.  It was as comfortable as you can reasonably expect a backpack holding a 22lbs child can be and was easy to use.  We spent a couple minutes figuring out the sun shade/canopy but once understood, we had no trouble. It's great for hiking and/or taking your child someplace where a stroller is difficult to maneuver.  It has pockets and a drink holder that are very handy.  My only fear while wearing it is that if I turn my ankle or something, then the big boy and I are both going down... but otherwise it seems very safe for him and me.I do notice that after he's been in the pack more than 30 minutes he gets a bit of a red mark on the insides of his legs if his bare leg touches on that part.  It doesn't appear to chafe him or anything... more of a pressure mark.  He's has chubby legs and the inside cradle for the child seems to be kinda wide in the crotch area (probably for support reasons) but it seems a bit too wide for him.  I try to make sure and put a little towel or cloth down there if he's going to be in it for awhile.  It totally doesn't seem to bother him at all (he loves being in the pack) but it does look red when I get him out of the pack.I would suggest starting out slowly and not going on a 45 minute walk the first time out (which I did because my son seemed to enjoy it so much!) because it can be a little tiring for your back the first time.  I was not in pain or anything (was in PAIN when I used the Baby Bjorn as soon as big boy hit the 18 pound-ish mark)but the area between my shoulder blades started to feel tired.  I also notice that I tend to slump or lean forward a little when I wear it.  My husband doesn't seem to do this though... could be because he's taller and the pack doesn't hit his bottom or could be due to the fact that women's center of gravity is in the caboose while men's center of gravity is in the shoulders (also noticable when women are learning to ice skate... they tend to stick out the booty more than men!).  My friend has the same backpack and said that she stopped leaning forward after she got more used to the pack so I think it's something that you stop doing once you're used to carrying that much weight on your back.Anyway, all in all I was very pleased with the cost and functionality of the pack.  This will also come in handy when we have our second so we won't have to buy a double stroller or anything.",4,1
Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain Carrier - Silver/Charcoal,I really have no complaints about the carrier and I would buy the same one if I could do it over again. The only thing I would change would be to have a stronger frame and better designed kidney pad so you can take off more weight from your shoulders. My child seems pretty comfortable in the carrier and has not complained or shown any signs of discomfort while riding in it for extended periods of time.,4,1
Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain Carrier - Silver/Charcoal,"I bought this carrier (after lots of searching and comparing) for the good price and looks. When I got it, I was so excited to try it. I wore it once (no problems, AWESOME!!) and my husband twice (he's 6'2"" and says it doesn't hurt his bad back), on the third time he put it on, he reached around to put the waist belt on and the big adjustable plastic piece snapped right off (btw, if you check the customers pics on here you'll see someone else had the EXACT problem!). He barely tugged on it! I immediatly wrote evenflo. They responded quickly and offered to fully refund my money because they couldn't send a replacement part since the brittle cheap plastic piece is SEWN into the belt. I was quite disappointed since this on flaw ruins the whole thing. I asked if I could just mail the plastic piece and get a refund, but the only way you can get a refund is to CUT OFF the shoulder straps AND waist belt and mail it to them - rendering the whole pack unusable. I don't think it's worth trashing the whole thing. I'm keeping it and found a much better material (flexible but sturdy, cloth covered foam) to replace the mistake Evenflo made. I will post pics of it on here soon. Hope that helps you with your decision, it really is a great pack and hopefully Evenflo will take my advice on that one issue.",4,1
"Tiny Love Musical Stack and Ball Game, Orange Elephant",My 1 yo loves this stacking elephant.  The rings come off easily and she loves putting them back on.  The toy comes with four balls that jingle.  The only thing is the bottom opening stays open so the balls come out immediately upon placing them down the tube.  I would have liked to seen them having to open the hatch to get the ball.  Overall great toy.,4,1
"Tiny Love Musical Stack and Ball Game, Orange Elephant","I bought this for a friend as a first birthday present.  I opened it up to put in the batteries for her, and played with it a bit.  I can see why people may complain about it not lighting up every time, as the ball needs to hit a button in the center of the cone to create the light and sound reward.  I really like the idea of this toy, and found it to be fairly high quality from what I can tell.  The one thing that surprised me was that although the rings are soft and the cone head of the elephant has some padding the whole thing has a hard plastic interior.  I was thinking that this would be squishy and a little huggable, but that's not really the design of it.  It is more designed to be an interactive toy for the balls and stacking hoops.  But it seems well made and is a creative approach to a stacking toy.",4,1

The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I used this item for about 4 weeks.  It was very nice to have baby so close.  My husband and I have a king sized bed and it worked fine.  If you have a queen sized bed, you may be a little cramped.  And if you have a full bed---forget it--one of the parents will be sleeping elsewhere!  I liked the product, hope you do too.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"It has sturdy sides to keep mom and dad off of it but enough mesh to allow air flow. I definitely recommend this to keep your baby close while you sleep.  It folds up and is easy to transport for a nap away from home, too.",4,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I had this when my daughter was a baby.  It was perfect.  It's soft, sturdy, easy to clean, and had great features.  I loved the part at the bottom.  I breastfed and this made my life so much easier.  It made cosleeping safer.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"We LOVED this item.  We were concerned about rolling over on our daughter while we had her sleeping in our bed, so this item avoided that problem.  We could check on her during the night and feed her without getting out of bed.  We used it for the first nearly 4 months, until she actually got so big that we cut the end off (obviously, not recommended) so she could stretch her legs for the last few weeks (she was unusually tall at 4 months, at 27"").  I can see using this only with a king-sized bed.  One would be too cramped in a queen-sized bed.  Note that each parent will have to use separate top blankets and sheets on either side of the sleeper.  The only downsides were (1) the nightlight, which I found useless because the light points up and so did not illuminate her face.  However, the light is removable, so I suppose one could use it by taking it out.  And (2), the manufacturer did not make extra fitted sheets last time I checked.  The sheet has velcro which keeps the little mattress in place (although it does not move much), and loose sheets are not recommended for reasons of safety.  Therefore, if the sheet gets soiled in the middle of the night, then good luck.  The mattress did flatten a little where her head was by the end of 4 months.  I have seen comments that the mattress is not soft, but it's really softer than our crib mattress.  The entire unit is machine washable (once certain parts are removed, which is easy), and we dried the whole thing in the dryer.  We would have brought the sleeper with us on a trip we took after she turned 4 months if she hadn't grown out of it so early.  The item was perfect until we transitioned her to her crib at 4 months.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I first bought an expensive Munire's crib for the baby room.  After a few days..... we realized that we want the baby to be near us so we can check up on her and not rely on the baby monitor and then having to get up, walk to the baby room, to see how she's doing.I bought this co-sleeper and am very happy with it.  It has a sturdy side so you can't just roll over on it.  It doesn't bend easily and requires some force.  The bedding is fairly firm but it's not 100% flat.The material is washable and the unit folds easily for transport.Downside:I don't think this will last a whole year.  My baby is only 2 months old and around 10lbs and she's pretty much going to kick down the foot-rest soon.  I think this will probably last me another 2 months (total of 4 months) before I need something bigger... or just move the big crib into the room.  :)",4,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I found this product to be the best product I had for my newborn son.  It is portable enough to move around the house easily.  My son slept in the living room while I was able to get things done around the house.  It then could move to his bassinet at night so I had peace of mind he would be in the same position through the night.  I used this for many many months.  After he became too long for it I took the positioner out and used that in the bassinet.  My son is 3 now, and every friend along the way who has had a baby I always buy this for them.  Every friend comes back after a month to express how great this product is.  One particular friend who travels said this is great because she doesn't need to bring a pack & play.  The light that comes with it is great because it is not too bright.  My light still works and is used often to this day as I check on my son at night.  This product is compact, portable, and built well.  Well worth the money for any mom.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,She has had her share of problems and cannot move much so with mostly breast feeding this has been a big help.,5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I bought this to co sleep with my newborn son, this made co sleeping easier and is easily portable, it comes with a small mattress similar to a plush changing pad, the mattress is water resistant and has a cover that is washable which is a nice feature. There are two drawbacks for me, 1. My son was 22"" at birth and outgrew the 24"" soon ( the lower barrier is not movable) and 2.  while the upper half is padded the lower half is just netted, my son had the habit of putting his legs out of the sleeper and would be half outside when he was a month old. Also this is just a co sleeper and not a sleep positioner.  still I like this product and would buy again if they made it in lengthier models.",4,1

Cloth Diaper Doublers,"I bought these to add an extra skin to liner layer because my cloth diaper fabric has either stopped absorbing or just cannot keep up with the heavier wetting as my son ages. These are indeed hand made as stated in the description. The fabric could probably stand to be pre-shrunk as some of them bunched in the wash but a little tugging to straighten works just fine. The fabric is nice and soft. I've used machine manufactured cheap liners from BuyBuyBaby and they are very similar in design but these are much nicer fabric and USA made by hand. you cant top that! If you think you can make them yourself, then by all means do so if you have the time. They are basic but you dont need bells and whistles to absorb urine, folks. 10 bucks is a far better value than using up a bunch of my time sewing now that my kiddo is on the run. I bought one set to test them out then I bought 6 more sets. Best purchase in my diapering experience thus far.",5,1

I ordered these at the same time, and, as stated in the reviews, these are great! They have held up perfectly!They not only held up, but also, you can put far more of these into the wipe warmer! That is important, because you will go through them lolI never dry them! I take them from the wash, fold them, put about 2-3 tablespoons of witch hazel in a gladware bowl with warm water then I drop them in folded, get them wet (not too wet) then transfer them to the warmer.

It's sturdy and washes well. I line dry, so staining hasn't been any issue.I keep them in a tub of a water/baby wash/tea tree oil solution, and love them.

OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"I am one of those people who has to try one of everything. I have theThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy, the Imported Flannel Wipes 15 pack - All unbleached, and some two sided 100% cotton terry cloth wipes from Green Mountain Diapers. In my opinion they all have pros and cons it really just depends what you are looking for.The Thirsties are by far the softest, even after washing in our very hard water. After a couple months the colors have stayed well and they are the cutest. I like the two sides, the longer side is great for getting bulk and the other side is very soft and gets anything that's left behind. They are the largest but fit ok (about 12) in my Prince Lionhart warmer if they are folded in half. They do kind of stick together so pulling one out one handed is more difficult. If you want something really soft and cute, go with these.The flannel wipes are the most cost-effective option. They are thin and sometimes require a little bit more scrubbing to get sticky messes clean. They are pretty soft also. The best thing about this is you don't have to worry about running out of wipes in the middle of a diaper change. You can fit at least 30 wipes folded in half in a warmer. They are also wash cloth size so they cover your hand well and I like that I don't have to worry about using too many wipes. So if you're looking for cost effective and ease of use I would go with these.The 100% cotton wipes are nice because they clean messes really well and they are fit to go into a warmer, so I don't have to do any fancy acrobatics to unfold anything. These are the least soft of the 3 and even though they aren't folded they take up a lot of room in the warmer and don't fit perfectly (the edges come up). They say they are two sided but I don't like using the smooth side at all, it doesn't seem to have much use to me. They are also smaller and so I usually have to use more and I end up with stuff on my hands more often than with the others. If you like 100% cotton these would be an ok choice but honestly I would probably go with Under The Nile Organic Cotton Baby Wipes - 6 Pack which sound like they're softer.",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"These wipes are perfect for making your own wipe mixture and avoiding chemical on your baby's skin. And sooo much more cost effective. I had thrown away hundreds of disposable wipes before I got these and they are just as soft. They don't ""slide"" as easily unless you get your soap/oil/water mixture right, that takes some experimenting. I just wash them along with the cloth diapers and then drop them back in a disposable wipe container filled with my soapy mixture, easy as pie. Unbleached is a plus too: no bleaching chemicals and stains don't show up as easily. Sunlight takes care of stubborn stains.",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"I just bought my second package of these not too long ago. Overall I would say you get what you pay for. These are one of these least expensive cloth wipes on the market, so they aren't expected to be of the highest quality. A few of the wipes in the most recent pack I bought started coming unraveled on the edges after the first wash. It certainly was annoying, but it doesn't affect the function of the wipe.When I (rarely) use disposable wipes it always takes twice as many of those as it does these to do the same job. Overall I would say I am happy with these and when I need more wipes, I will probably buy these ones again.",4,1

Baby Trend Side By Side Jogger,"My twin boys were born at 38 wks. and were large for their age, so we used this stroller since they were 2 mo. and on.  We have had NO problems with this stroller, and for the money, it's great.  My boys are now 2+ years old and we still love this stroller.  Granted- we only use it for outside walks, and we don't have to walk through doorways (with any double stroller that is difficult!)- but we love the storage underneath, the double cup holder/storage place for mom, and the price!  If you are looking for a stroller for the daily stroll, this works great.  I bought it because I didn't want to have to use my ""indoor"" stroller (Maclaren Twin Traveler) for outside activities.  So far, I love the amount of stroller I have received for the price.",5,1
Baby Trend Side By Side Jogger,"We have this jogger, though ours is 4 years old!!  We have twin daughters who are now 4.  We purchased this stroller when they were 3 months old, and this was the best purchase of everything we purchased.

We would walk to our neughborhood park everyday in the first 2 years of my girls' lives.  Our Graco Duoglider was just too heavy to push on our gravel-like paths in our neighborhood.  A jogger is the way to go if that's what you need it for.  We used this jogger almost everyday for 3 years, and it has held up VERY well!!  My girls have always loved it too!!  There is no need to buy more expensive jogger strollers.  It isn't very heavy, so an aluminum one isn't necessary.  I highly recommend this double jogger if a jogger is what you are looking for.  We are expecting our 3rd child now, so we'll be selling our double so we can buy a single!",5,1
Baby Trend Side By Side Jogger,"After reading mixed reviews my husband and I decided to give this one a try! We love it! We have 2 boys one is 2 1/2 and the other is 10 months.

My husband also loves to push it because the handles are comfortable for him even at 6'4"""". The parent tray with cupholders and the 5 point harnesses are a definite plus!! I also love how the baskets are a good size and are accessible even when the seats are reclined! I am so glad we took a chance on this one!",5,1

We remembered our old ""Gerry Pack"" we had for both of our childern some 30 years ago and searched for an updated verson.The carrier performed great.  We found it easy to make the initial adjustments to fit the child, it was comfortable to carry with his 25 plus pounds of weight. Most important he loved being up at our level, was happy while waiting for the flight in the congested airport.  We found it easy to get through security but most important easy to board and get settled on the aircraft being able to carry him to the seat, simply remove him from the pack and plop him into his carseat.While we originaly thought we use it just for travel, we now use it every day on the mile walk to the post office to get our mail.The only negative observation would be that it probably does not fit well enough to use on long hikes over rough trails. Even with frequent adjustments, the hip strap and pad doesn't quite fit.  It offers three adjustments, none of which quite make it for my frame.",4,1
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"First I want to say - buy this or something BEFORE your baby starts to gnaw on the crib. By the time that happens, the idea of doing a little research and ordering something online goes out the window. What are you doing baby! That's your awesome crib we bought and lovingly put together for you!I can be a bit of a perfectionist, so I took all the time to read the directions, apply the alcohol, wait for it to dry, etc. Even trying to be as careful as could be, I had a lot of trouble getting these to go on the crib straight. Not a big deal for some. For others, it may totally ruin the whole appearance of the crib to have a crooked, wavy crib rail. It would have been easier to keep straight if I started in the middle and pushed the sides down evenly, but I wanted to leave a little bubble of air under the top to provide some extra cushion.One last tip - it can take a couple of days for the adhesive to really set, so again, don't wait until your baby is already chewing things up, or this thing will probably just get pulled off. Once the adhesive has really set, you may be more worried about pulling paint off the crib when (if) it comes time to take this off.",4,1
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,My daughter was tearing up her crib really bad with her teeth - I applied this product according to the directions - and it has worked wonderfully! It has not peeled off at all and she is still chewing on it all the time! I have had it for 4-5 months and no problems at all!,5,1
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,This is a good product. I installed the Gummi protector by myself. It was super easy to install. It would fit many different sized rails.,4,1
"Sassy Teething Feeder, Colors May Vary","Our first baby wasn't interested in using the feeder - and we tried several different items inside.  I thought it was a great idea and know plenty of parents who love it.  We tried it with our second and he LOVES it!  He's interested in EVERYTHING we put inside.  It's great to use when you're out but of course bring a bib.  Using the feeder, keeps him occupied during dinner and he loves feeding himself (but hasn't yet master the pincher grasp).  In addition, to frozen fruits/veggies as well as a few fresh fruits, we also use the teething biscuits which prevents him from choking/gagging (again babies are different b/c my first son didn't have a problem with the teething biscuits but our second does...so the feeder works great).  Each baby is different but honestly I think it's worth a try!",5,1
Sea Life Wall Hanging,I just rec'd these today and I used velcro stickers to hang them they worked great.  It is the perfect finishing touch to our baby's room.  It is a must have if you have the bedding set.  SO CUTE!,5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I wouldn't be able to live without this dual pump breastpump! My only regret is that I didn't purchase it before my daughter was born, so that I could have relieved my engorgement! I have used this pump from the beginning, and now that I am back to work, I am so glad that I spent the extra money on this pump. I have a friend who purchased the single pump, and she quit breastfeeding after four months because it took too long and she didn't want to spend the extra money on the dual pump. I have been strictly breastfeeding for almost five months, and I know that I can go for the entire first year, which is well beyond what I expected I'd be able to do when I was still pregnant. Definitely purchase the hands free bustier from La Leche Connection on ebay, so that you can type or do other things while pumping. I can even get ready, blow dry my hair, and do my makeup while pumping! It's a must!",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby.  This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006.Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:-1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise.3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry.4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply.5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops.This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it!",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,I absolutly loved this pump..It worked wonders..I could pump out a 9oz bottle in 15 minutes..I would recommend this pump to EVERYONE!!!,5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I've been using my Medela Advanced Pump in Style for 4 months now and absolutely love it. It allows me to work full-time and continue to breastfeed. When I first started pumping I had to keep it on the slower setting, but after a few weeks I was able to pump at maximum without any discomfort. I'm extremely happy with the pump as well as the company. I recently had a problem witb the power cord that was my fault, and the company overnighted me a new one at no charge. I highly recommend this product to Moms who are looking for a quality pump. The only negative is the Medela breastfeeding bags are twice as expensive as the Lansinoh ones. I've used both and can't tell a difference, so I buy the cheaper ones now. Make sure you get yourself a small bottle of dishsoap to put in the side pocket to clean everything while you're on the go. My insurance company actually paid for the pump, so check yours before you buy.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"This is the best pump ever. I heard that pumps aren't really worth it and that a lot of people don't get their money's worth with a pump. However, I had no choice as I was going back to work and formula was not an option. I had heard about this pump before, but now that I have it I have to say- I don't know how working moms do without this. I can see why they may stop b-feeding without this easy, handy, extremely efficient pump when away from baby! I first used this when baby was about 1 week old (pumped whenever I was full and baby was not hungry), and I am still using it every day 1-2 times a day (Baby almost 6 mos. old). I can pump a full 7-11 oz in 8 MINUTES!! Set up, pumping, and cleanup takes me 15 total! From what I understand regular P-N-S takes 15 pumping time, which isn't much diff. But when I have a mtg. in 15, I can always make time to pump. Medela customer service is great, too. I had a problem w/the faceplate and called their service line. W/no hassle/proof of purchase or anything, she quickly sent me a replacement face plate that came w/specific easy instructions.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I have used several breast pumps, and I finally found the one that REALLY works.  It costs more, but the price of formula is so high, this breast pump will pay for itself in about a month.  This breast pump is a DREAM Come True !!  Comfortable, quick, effecient !!!I would also like to share a money saving idea... You can save money on Diapers, Formula, wipes and baby supplies at 1-800-Diapers on the internet.  FREE Shipping, no sales tax, great prices !!  Use Referral CODE:  BRST3227 to SAVE $2.00 off your first order !!  This code does NOT expire.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I love this pump.  It is quiet, comfortable, easy to use, makes pumping time faster etc.  I tried the small Medula electric pump (yellow one) and it hurt and was noisy.  Couldn't talk on the phone while pumping for sure- people would always know I was pumping.  This pump is pricey but worth it.  It saves you money on formula.  Unfortunately I could only pump for about 8 weeks because my milk  started to slow down quite a bit, plus at my job it is near impossible to pump during the day.  There is only one bathroom for men and women and I share an office with two other people.  I will use again if we ever have a second child.  Maybe this next baby will latch on (which helps produce more milk) next time.  I started trying to breastfeed a little to late with this baby b/c she was born during Hurricane Rita.  The extra stress and delayed start of trying to breastfeed didn't help my milk production.  I still think 8 weeks of using this pump was worth the $320.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I know that this is a more expensive pump, however it is well worth the money.  We are on our second child and the electric pump has been there all the way!  Manual pumps lack the x-tra power needed when you want to breast feed and just don't produce enough, but the electric has the power to make it happen.  I have tried manual pump's but they do not work anywhere as great as this one.  Don't waste the money searching for the right pump, buy this one and put your worries about breast feeding behind you.  P.s. note that any electric Medela pump would be a smart buy.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I originally used the Avent hand pump, but I realized after 2 months that I had to get an electric pump because my hand hurt and it took too long to pump.  I absolutely love this pump.  I accidentally sat on one of the tubes and it caused a piece to break off of the plug, but it still keeps suction and I haven't had to replace it.  I will with the next baby though.  It's relatively quiet for an electric pump too.  The bag is cute and discreet so I never feel awkward carrying it.  I would recommend buying the steam cleaning bags too -- they'll save you a lot of time.  I really think that this pump made it possible for me to return to work and continue to nurse.  Well worth the money, especially if you plan to have another baby in the future.  Don't forget to buy the car adapter as well!",5,1
BabyTrend ActivPak in Black,"I ordered this bag the week after our son was born and we take it EVERYWHERE!  We have used this bag for 16+ months now and that means EVERYDAY!  My son came to work with me for the first year of his life (a huge blessing -- I know) and the bag carried everything I needed...all of his stuff, my breast pump, extra bottles, my lunch, and even doubled as my purse for that first year (because you don't have enough hands otherwise!).  This bag is absolutely perfect and is still like brand new -- which is great as I'll be using it for baby #2 who is on the way and it will be used as everything once again!",5,1
BabyTrend ActivPak in Black,I received 2 of these bags at my baby shower and didnt send either one of them back. I am into the whole comfort of backpacks for diaper bags and this bag holds sooo much in it. Has many pockets if you just want to place items in specific areas. It also has separate mesh compartments within the inside of the bag. This is definitely the best bag to get. I have given this bag and even placed it on a couple of registries. Those who have cared for my son say that this bag is wonderful as much as it holds.,5,1
Munchkin Three Tri-Flow 8oz. Angled Bottles (Colors May Vary),"These bottles I purchased were originally a gift. My son enjoyed them so much I had to continue to buy them. Great for a child with feeding/swallowing issues. The different """"flows"""" on the bottle make it easier to adjust as your baby grows.",5,1
Munchkin Three Tri-Flow 8oz. Angled Bottles (Colors May Vary),This bottle seemed to be easier for my son to drink from and hold.  Milk would not spill out of his mouth like it would with other name brand bottles.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station,"great drying station for your baby's bottles and nipples and pacifiers and stuff like that, be sure to cover with a clean kitchen towel to prevent flies from touching them though, would definitely recommend to anyone!",5,1
"Parent Units TV Guard Button Blocker, 10&quot;X1&quot;","we have an island with a microwave and an oven in it and these work great. my son can take them off from time to time, but at least they deter him a little. and i wonder if it may even be because i don't always push them hard enough when I reinstall them. overall, we're happy with these",5,1
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I never used these for milk storage, but I use it for everything else. The twist cap makes it foolproof and easy to use. It took me some time to discover it was a twist cap, since I thought it was a snap on, but my kids can't open them without my help. I think they don't realize it is a twist cap. Perfect for snacks, just the right amount.",4,1
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I used these cups when my younger child was breastfeeding, now that my kids are both at school I send their snacks stored in them.I'm pregnant again, so I'm looking for new ones.",5,1
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I intended to use these for breast milk storage, but since BF didn't work out for me, they were stuck in the closet unopened. Now that my baby is weaning, I decided to give these a try for homemade food storage. They're excellent! They hold enough food, seals well in the freezer, pops out without any effort and I know exactly how much I'm feeding her. I seriously love them! I can make big patches of food, immediately freeze them. To defrost, I run them in water for a few seconds, open the lid and the contents slip right out to a bowl to heat up. Easy peasy, no spills and no messing with cling wrap! Best part is they're BPA free.",5,1
Koala Baby Hampton Nautical Sailboat Stripe Musical Crib Mobile,I get it as gift from my Baby Shower and match whit all entire Hampton nursery collection in my Baby's Room!!!is so cute and i don't have any problem with this musical mobile....the only problem was with my Baby he doesn't like stay in his crib or bassinet now he's 6 months and still he won't.100% RECOMMENDED,5,1
Graco Pack 'n Play Playard Quilted Sheet - Navy,"THAT LITTLE EXTRA PADDING THAT FITS TIGHTLY AND WASHES EASILY.SLIGHTLY PRICY, BUT WELL WORTH IT!",5,1
Graco Pack 'n Play Playard Quilted Sheet - Navy,"I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors.",4,1
Tiddliwinks Baby Travel Fitted Sheet,These are nice and vibrant. My twin boys are enjoying the colors and pictures.,4,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,The first breast shields I got were two pieces (the shield and a connector thing) These are all one piece. Easier to clean and generally deal with.And for those new to pumping... Someone told me that I needed three full set ups to go back to work and pump each day. That means you need 6 breast shields-- I ordered half as many as I needed on the first try!,5,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,This shield is easier to clean than the ones I got with pump machine.  I also love the idea of having extras to keep rotation of cleaning them easier for me!,5,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,"This replacement piece works better than the original that came with my pump. It is an excellent value, fits with the hoses and bottles perfectly, and has better suction.",5,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,"For the mom who has to express, multiple shield sets is a must (unless you want to be washing parts constantly).  The one-piece set has worked the best for me.  My pump came with a 2-piece shield, and I've dropped full bottles a few times because the shield got jostled and came apart.  The only problem with the one-piece set is that it is harder to dry in a hurry because towels can't get into the little nooks and crannies of the unit.",4,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,"According to the wife, these work better than the ones that come with the actual Medela PISA pumps.  The single piece makes it easier to clean and the bottles have no way of falling off when moving around.  The parts that come with the pump have a removable suction cup from the connector, so the connector has a chance of slipping off if its just a little bit loose.  This single piece also makes it cheaper than buying all the parts separately.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Khaki",I bought this item for my daughter's baby.  It is so very nice.  It fits the car seat very well.  I know this winter it will come in very handy not to have to fight with big snow suits.  I would highly recommend this item.,5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Khaki",This is an amazing product. It can very easily be used in a stroller and a car seat. It does what it is supposed to do I.e. Keep your baby warm in those harsh wintery conditions.,5,1
Winnie The Pooh - Peek a Pooh Wall Border,"The border looks fantstic on the walls.  All our relatives loved it and said how professional it looked.  We did buy roll on glueto make sure it stuck to the walls, rather than wetting it and hoping it would last.  It was so easy to apply.  I enjoyed decorating my granddaughters nursery and I would recommend this border to any one who was using the Winnie the Pooh theme.",5,1
Medela Spare Membranes for Breatpumps 6 Pack,"OEM membranes work perfectly - and if you're having problems with building or maintaining your milk supply or getting enough suction from your pump, try replacing these.  HUGE difference IMO!",5,1
Medela Spare Membranes for Breatpumps 6 Pack,"These membranes are great. If you're pumping it's good to always have extras on hand. If you find your pump losing suction, replacing the membrane is often the trick to fixing it.",5,1
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"I love our Co-sleeper!!! We have twin boys and they are 13 weeks and just now transitioning into their cribs. They have sleep in the co-sleeper since coming home and it is perfect! The original size is great for twins or for one baby who is bigger. The weight limit is 30 lbs. for the higher level which sold us as the pack n'plays are only 15 lbs. I can't recommend this enough, it truly has been a lifesaver to just reach over and have access to a baby. You can also buy lifts, but our bed is pretty tall and we didn't need them.",5,1
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"Ok, if you are parent desperate to have a good night sleep for you and your baby, this will definitely make it easier'''''PROS''''''a) you can see your baby and touch him (no need to wake up desperate and having to get out of bed to see if he is still breathing)b) he can see you and smell you(if he feels safe, he sleeps better)c) it is easier to move your baby from tummy position to back (SIDS prevention)d) firm but comfortable mattress (happy baby, sleepy baby, my baby hated the graco pack n play mattress)e) easy to attach to bed (or if you do not want to do it, just put the bassinet against the wall and your bed against the bassinet)f)has a separation between you and baby (one of the sides of the bassinet), that is not to high, but just enough for you to feel safe you are not going to roll on top of your baby.g) Big enough for tummy time and big enough for older infants (1 inch longer than Graco pack n play)h)Matress stands 2 inches higher than a graco playpen, so to get you baby out and on the bassinet (when you are standing up) is easier on your backi) easy to clean, one piece of fabric lining around the plastic structure (velcro)'''''CONS'''''a) if your bed is like mine 18 inches tall, the bassinet is a little high for you bed (it is not that bad, but it makes harder to pick your baby up and you probably will need to sit). the UNIVERSAL bassinet from their line would resolve that issue, but i could not find it anywhereb) the railing that make one of the sides go down is tricky and if you want to put it up, you need to get your baby from itc) It is not the easiest to assemble and it is heavy...even my husband has a hard time doing it and travelling with it is a hassled)it does not have wheels!!!!the mini has them, but the mini is too small for any baby more than 2 months olde)there are two things that support the mattress (the fabric lining and steel tubing) the tubing is very flimsy and if you put too much weight on one side it falls apart)f) it is uglyoverall: awesome, would buy a million times over, my baby would not sleep for 2 months (colic), a place where he likes sleeping in made the difference and now he is good sleeper and im not freaking out anymore to check on him all the time, i can just look at him breathing. ps: DO NOT BUY THE MINI, TOO SMALL",4,1
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"If you cosleep this is the best bed. It is good looking, firm for babies safety. I have it right next to our bed and it is great.",5,1
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"I choose 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the mattress.The mattress is just too firm and this has been a consistent issue with everyone that bought this product.I bought a mattress topper and cut it to the shape of the co-sleeper. My infant has slept comfortably since thenNonetheless, it is a real great product. Especially for those breast feeding. I would recommend it. Also keep in mind when buying this that it comes in varying sizes. There are smaller ones out there. I got the convertible because it can be converted to a play yard has my infant gets older.",4,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,I finally left the mommy car and went to a luxury sedan. This seat saver is exactly that! Fits nicely and has a pocket for her to keep her electronic play toys.,5,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,Glad to have these heavy duty covers for the seats in our car.  The front edge of the seat is covered so the feet of children don't get the seat all dirty.  Very easy to use and stow away.,5,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,"In looking for a seat protector for my leather seats I looked at a lot of different products and ended up settling on this one which I do not regret.  I tighten the car seat down very firmly so there is definitely the distinct possibility of issues with seat wear.  Due to this protector I haven't had any issues over the last two years and just bought another one for our second kid.Bottom line: This item protects the seat from indentation, wear marks, and many child related messes.",5,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,"Good price, great item! Does exactly what it says and what I need it to. My kids have fun stashing items in the pockets, I have fun not getting my seats stained and sprinkled with cheerios!",5,1

Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,Fits perfectly in my Hyundai Car. Easy to fix and gives good support to car seat/base. Wide enough for my car seat. Has storage pocket but I am not sure if I will need it as I already have back seat organizer and diapering station to go.,5,1

The First Years Two Receiver 49 MHz Monitor,"I have my daughter every other weekend. When she would sleep, I would jump to check on her when there was any type of sound that could have been a cry.  I hated how her mother's monitoring device had feedback and picked up everything; from a door slamming to someone bouncing a ball down the street.  At first I thought it was so silent (lack of background noise) that it would miss her grumps as she starts to wake up, not so with this device.  It was clear and picked up her first peeps.  Good stuff and thank you. - Single Dad",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"I can't say enough good things about this swing! We started using it the day my son came home from the hospital and spent time in it (and often napped in it) every day until he was about 6 months old. We loved that the colors were very neutral and pleasing. Since it was in our living room we didn't want anything to bright or ""babyish"". I was a little worried about having to replace the batteries often, but we only had to change them twice in 6 months with daily use. We never used the tray so it was great that it could be completly removed - this also made it easier to get him in and out and to place blankets over him. My son loved the music and nature sounds, and they weren't annoying like some musical toys. He didn't really notice the mobile and mirror until he was about 2 months old, but once he found them, he was mesmerized. The mirror was great because he loved looking up at his reflection when the mobile wasn't moving. One minor issue with this swing is that is takes up a lot of space. If you have a small space then this might not be the best choice.All in all, this swing was among the best purchased we made for our baby and would recommend it to anyone!",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"I love that this swing goes both side to side and back and forth. i like the neutral color scheme, however i feel like if it were more colorful it would hold my 3 month old's attention longer. when she was just a few weeks old she would sit and nap in this swing all day, now she will only sit in it for 20-30 minutes at a time, but hey thats long enough to empty the dishwasher or start a load of laundry !! overall i have been very happy with this swing and found it well worth the money.",4,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing is by far the best one on the market.  t was nice to change up the direction of the swing, it is easy to use, and it looks nice in your home!  Our son loved this (along with the Papasan bouncer) because it was SOOOO comfortable, and there is room to grow.  He is getting ready to use the toy attachment...He has taken many naps in this and always slept so peacefully.  He LOVED the mirror on top and that was a selling point for me.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We love the swing. Bought 2 for our twins, they're 8 months old and still using them. There are 2 things I would change: it needs a vibrating seat or at least the option to turn on something vibrating. And I wish the seat could turn in both directions. We have limited space and have them side by side, would be nice to be able to turn the seats so that the kids can face each other. Other than that, the best investment we made for our sanity. :)",4,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"When our daughter was a mere two days old, I said to my wife, ""I don't know how much this swing costs, but whatever it was, it was worth it.""  This swing seems to help our little girl to fall asleep and *stay* asleep when other bouncy seats fail to soothe her.The swing is supposed to have six speeds, but I rarely turn it above the lowest speed.  There doesn't seem to be much variation among the speeds; they seem to range from ""very fast"" to ""really fast.""  Frankly, I wouldn't care if it only had one speed.I could go on and on about this swing, but really, what else do you need to know?  It's wonderful.  You should stop reading this review right now and buy it.  No, really.  Do it now.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This has been the nicest swing.  I also used a Graco and when the baby got tired his head slumped to the side and hit the support bar when the swing was going back and forth.  This one cradles his head beautifully (and that hair rubbing off issue that has been mentioned is something that happens to a lot of babies at 3 months or so - Jack's hair rubbed off in the crib as he moved his head and most of the rest fell out, but at maybe 5 months it grew back.  The swing didn't do it to him).  He sleeps so well in this, so I can shower or do other work.  Now that he's 21 lbs the swing motor has to work harder - the front to back swing position works better than side to side because his heavy head can slow the swinging if it's to one side.  He has grabbed the animals so many times really hard and has never broken the mechanism (you can turn the mobile off so that it is out of baby's reach).  It is true that no matter how wide you push the legs, one seems to lift a tiny bit when it swings (on hardwood floor), but I don't put it above 2 speed.  The Graco also seemed to have only a very fast swing that did not relax him, whereas this Papasan is perfect.  He loves the mirror as well.  I attach toys to the tray to give him more to play with.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This is a very nice swing.  The color of the swing matches almost any decor.  The seat is very plush, my daughter loves laying in it, and sleeps very well in it.  The mobile is adorable and the mirrored bottom of the mobile really keeps her attention.  She is four weeks old and was a month early.  She weighs about 8 pounds now and even the lowest setting on the swing is a little too strong.  I don't see much difference between the lowest setting and the stronger settings. The swing does not shut off after seven minutes only the music/mobile.  It would be convenient if this swing had a remote control so the parents could control everything with one remote. Even better would be if this swing had a plug to save on batteries.  Then it would be perfect! It is a little pricey but well worth it.  As far as the swings go this is my favorite, just has a few things that could be improved upon.  It is a little noisy swinging back and forth but that noise actually seems to sooth my daughter.  The toys on the tray could be a little more exciting but at this point my daughter is so amazed by the mirror/mobile she doesn't even use the tray.",4,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing is worth the money.  My baby was comfortable in it from the beginning and it is so quiet we don't even notice it.  Now that he is older, he is really enjoying watching the leaves and birds rotate and watching himself in the relective mirror above.  He also struggled badly with reflux and had to sleep at a 45% angle at all times and this swing was one of the few places where he would sleep for long stretches.  It is one of the few things I would not want to live without.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We bought this swing when our son was three months old. We received the Ocean Wonders Take Along Swing as a shower gift and we loved its compact size and portability, but we wanted a full size, stationary swing as well. The idea of the back and forth and side to side motion plus the cozy looking papasan seat really appealed to us, so we decided to spend a little extra and get this swing. (We did look at the Ocean Wonders version of the cradle swing and just liked the look of Nature's Touch better.)For a while, our son seemed like he would never sleep through the night. For several months this swing was the only thing guaranteed to put him out and get him to stay out for several hours at a time (always supervised, of course).He's turning one year old in a week, and we have another baby on the way, due March 8th. I'm sure we'll be putting this swing to good use again.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing was a God send. Initially when I saw it to add to my registry I thought it looked nice and cozy with all the plush swaddling surrounding in the seat; I had no idea it would be such a KEY item for my son. My first son never enjoyed his swing, I wont mention the make but it wasnt Fisher Price. Anyhow, this swing was a definite great choice, my son practically lives in it. At night he likes to swing back and forth and sets the pace for the night and during the day he swings from side to side. He loves it, the swinging and the music. I havent gotten past the first settings with the lullabies but all of the sounds are great. I even find myself getting sleepy hearing them. It was a great buy and I definitely recommend it. I put my son in it at about a month and a half and he was only 7 lbs 9 oz. which is a nice size but not too big- by that time he had to be 8 lbs at least. I think the positioning of the seat makes it more comfortable for a smaller baby, and the more upright seating as they get older and bigger.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We had picked this swing & put it on our registry when we found out we were having a girl (our 1st girl) & recieved it @ our baby shower & we loved it. It is a great color which could be used for a girl or boy unlike alot of swings are blue-which I hate. We had a graco with our 1st baby (boy) & he never seemed to like the swing much so when we had our 2nd baby boy & he absolutely hated the graco we looked for a cradle swing which I got off e-bay, it was ok but didn't have the braces to make it more stable-although my 2nd would actually swing in it side to side, we re-sold that one & bought the aquarium swing- it was great until it broke beyond repair-the aquarium part @ the top broke off that held the seat together. So we didn't really want to buy another just like it esp since we were having a girl. My 3rd baby is now 2 1/2 weeks old & she loves it. I don't have to worry about her head bobbing b/c of the headrest & it's nice & wide & extremely soft. It is by far worth the price. Everything about it is wonderful. My only gripe is that the music & mobile shuts off  after a few minutes. I love everything else about it.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"I had recieved this swing for a gift off my registry list, and what a choice it was.  I am completely happy with the swing.  My son was born in April and weighed 7 lbs 7 oz.  He was very small, but we began using the swing right away.  It is the only way he would sleep when he was not laying with me.  As he has grown the swing is still his number one choice to sleep in. He is now much bigger, about 16 lbs and 26 inches long.  His feet are begining to dangle over the end.  He still loves to look at himself in the mirror and watch the birds go around his head.  He enjoys the toys that are attached and I have made some modifications to them by adding link-a-dos with toys so that he has a variety to choose from.  He mostly likes the laying down position.  I have recommended the swing to many people looking in the store.  I swear by the swing.  If them made if for adults I would buy one for myself.  I think this swing, in comparisions to the ones my friends have, is way better than any other on the market.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"At 11 weeks old this is by far the most used item we bought(besides the boppy for breastfeeding). Now that she is developing more she stares at herself in the mirror while she swings and loves to watch the bugs go round and round. The batteries haven't even pooped out yet! This is great to put her in when she is calm and tired or alert, but you can't put her in here crying because it isn't a cure all.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"For the first 4 months this swing was where our baby napped best.  It was quiet and smooth, and she would just be lulled right to sleep. We also dealt with gas issues early on, and she was more comfortable in the swing than flat on her back when she was gassy.  She was also a big fan of the overhead mirror and spinning animals.  This was my first experience with a baby swing, but I would definitely use this model again.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"My daughter is 3 1/2 months old and has loved this swing since she came home from the hospital.  My daughter take great naps and enjoys looking in the mirror.  I thought it went to fast in the beginning, but once I tried it out, I found she loved it.  She takes her morning nap in it almost everyday.  I wish they made one in my size.  It is worth every penny.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"Reasons why I love this swing:1. My daughter was almost 10 lbs at birth and the other ones she didn't like. She was too big for them. This one accomidates larger babies.2. Babies can use the swing till they are a little older.3. It cradles the baby. She was more comfortable in this one4. The pattern is neutral5. The music is real music!! And it has nature sounds as well. My daughter loves those.6. She can either swing from side to side or front to back.7. The material is softer.The only change I would make would be the mobile. I would make them to where she could see the faces of the birds. They turn and move, but she can't see them all that well. She still likes to watch them move. Overall Awesome!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing has been such a lifesaver for us. Our son still loves it at 10mths. He's also big for his age too, and none of the other swings at his daycare for instance can still accomodate him.The motor did die on us (after 8mths of heavy usage), but when I called up Fisher Price to see what kind of warranty they had on this thing -- they immediately arranged for a replacement to be shipped free of charge. Motor arrived in 3 days time and was dead easy to replace (they just ship out the whole top part of the swing, minus the legs and cradle).Awesome product!",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We absolutely love this swing! It is by far the best purchase I have EVER made! My only complaint is that my son does not want to be held anymore! He lives in this swing!We chose this swing because of the neutral colors and the comfortable looking seat along with the side-to-side swinging. I liked having the option of side-to-side swinging or back and forth swinging. (My daughter is nine & I never felt comfortable with her swing because it would practically send her to the moon!)This swing has a slow setting that actually works with newborn! The shape, size and contour of the swing makes it PERFECT even for a newborn because their head doesn't fall forward constantly. My son will sleep in it for hours!I also like being able to change the music and sounds. It works in so many different ways that the baby is never bored. The toy bar is also wonderful!All of my friends with new babies are jealous of this swing! Everyone I know that has a baby younger than my son has choosen it (mainly off of seeing how much he loves it!) and all of my pregnant friends are getting it! I have friends & co-workers who have also purchased it for their grandchilren.This is a wonderful, durable, exciting product that is worth every penny! -Now if they only made one for adults!-",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing is excellent - my baby fell and stayed asleep in it since he was 1 week old.  Now at 6 months, he still naps in it!  I would give it 5 stars, except that the function that makes the mobile turn does not work well after many uses.  Also, the swing eats up a lot of batteries after a while.  But I'd recommend it highly to anyone - it's the most comfortable swing for a baby!",4,1

Koala Baby Canvas Folding Bin - Sage,"I have these in pink and green and other than it being more 'mint' than 'sage' (picture shows actual color, so it's not too deceiving), I love it. They are sturdy, won't collapse in on themselves and it can hold quite a bit of stuff. I am using them for books, toys, shoes, and other items that need to be 'herded.' I also have three for changing table items like diapers, burp cloths, lotion, and health care items.",5,1
Baby Trend High Chair Palm Tree,I recently bought this chair at our local Babies R Us store.  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.  My 5 month old loves it.  I can tell she feels like a big girl now in her own chair.  It came fully assembled except for the bottom coasters.  The brakes work wonderully even on hardwood and ceramic tile.  Everything can be done with one hand.  I know we will definitely get our moneys worth on this chair.,5,1
Baby Trend High Chair Palm Tree,I have used this highchair since my infant was 4 months old. I used it without the tray and she liked being able to sit up and watch us at the kitchen table.  I started using the tray recently at around 8 months and the tray is still pretty high. With the raised edge she still can't see little pieces of food that are on the tray. At 9 months its still about armpit height for her. I wish I could lower it for her.She likes it and I like everything else about the highchair.,4,1
Baby Trend High Chair Palm Tree,"I like everything about the highchair except that the tray is difficult to move with one hand and the position of the tray is very high for an infant.  I'm sure it will be better when my daughter gets a little bigger, and hopefully with a some time, the tray will slide much easier.  As far as the other features, the recline options are great, the seat position is versatile for different heights, and the wheels roll well on carpet and vinyl.  I love how well padded it is too.  It seems very comfortable.  Overall, a great buy.",4,1
Capri Stroller - Red Tech,"This stroller is the best baby thing my money has bought!When my little one grew out of her bulky travel system, my husband and I decided that a lightweight stroller was our best option.We love the outdoors and we needed some wheels that would make it.  We have used and abused this poor stroller. Not only do we take it to our local parks every weekend, the mall and the beach, what really impressed me was our latest vacation: we took it to South America for a 17 day vacation. It made it through a round-trip airplane ride, climbed up and down very steep, rocky mountains, went to two different farms, traveled through unpaved sidewalks and lastly stone and brick-paved 500 year-old cities.I have to say, I am impressed. Nothing is bent, the wheels are still strong, everything looks as new as when we first purchased it. We did have to hose it down a few times, but it still looks great.The only reason I am giving it four stars, is based on the flimsy top. Everything else is awesome. Coulnd't beat the price.On a side note, a few friends have gone through their share of $20 folding strollers (and they just take them to the mall), which add up to more than I spent for mine.",4,1

"Nuby No Spill Sipper, Colors May Vary, 10 Ounce","I found these cups to be the best to transition from the bottle to cup because they have silicone spouts.  Since they feel similar to a bottle, my kids took them easier at first than the plastic sippies.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  However, as other reviewers pointed out, the spout doesn't last long if your child chews on it.  It is also annoying that it is so hard to line the spout up to correctly face the way that baby is supposed hold it.  It is nice that there are no extra valves and parts to take apart to clean though.  Overall its not a terrible cup for as cheap as it is.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"This is the first time that I ever used any kind of diaper disposal system, and someone actually told me not to get this one.  However, I have been pretty happy with this so far.  I have not had a problem at all with the odor coming from the diaper genie like some of the other customers say.  The only time that you even smell an odor is when you open it to put in another diaper.  But, let's be honest, don't you smell an odor when you put something in the trash can too?  You can't really expect to smell nothing when you open any diaper disposal system!  Plus, there was about 3 weeks that I didn't use the diaper genie(and I forgot to empty it), and neither me nor my husband nor any of our guests ever smelled one thing(I have it in my living room right now as we are waiting for the babies room to be finished)  It seems to fit quite a bit of diapers in it...more than I thought that it would.  Also, the disposal of the diapers into a trash can is very easy.  All you have to do is hold down the scissor button and turn the knob until the scissor button pops up.  Open the bottom and dump them out.  No mess, no worrying about dropping diapers anywhere.  The only thing about this is that sometimes it does not cut the film all the way, so I would check it before you decide to dump out all the diapers.  I usually just cut it with scissors if it did not cut all the way.  The only real downside that I have seen to the Diaper Genie so far is that the refills are pretty expensive.  But, I'm still on my first refill and have used it pretty religiously for 2 months now.  Overall, I am satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone out there looking for a diaper disposal system.",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"This thing is really good at eliminating odors in the house.  How to conserve the specialty plastic:  First:tie a really tight knot when you start, otherwise it can leak.  Second, you twist the inner lid after each diaper, but instead of just adding another diaper to make a sausage-link-like chain, untwist and add the next diaper, then twist again.  The odors are controlled.  All the diapers wind up in a single ""bag"" you use a LOT less plastic than if you make a chain of diapers.",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,I really love my diaper genie it holds about one week of diapers with no smell. It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it. Changing bags is easy too. Every new mom should have one of these.,5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I have used Diaper Genie for seven years now.  I purchased the New Genie to replace my old worn out one, and it is easier to use.  The only problems I have is occasionally the plastic won't cut if I get things in the wrong position.  You have to learn from experience to get the technique down right.  Be sure after cutting the plastic to turn the handle while open to get the cutter to click back to the original position.  I have loved using Diaper Genie!  It keeps things so neat!An experienced mom and grandma.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I have been using the diaper genie for over five weeks now and it has exceeded my expectations. The refills last a lot longer than you would think and they are inexpensive. Also, I have not smelled one dirty diaper that I have put in there due to the scent the refills have. It is so simple to use and simple to dispose of the diapers once the diaper genie is full. I think that this is the best diaper disposal system on the market. I have been recommending it to all of my family and friends.",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I have a toddler and used the diaper genie religiously from birth until she was about 20 months old.  Only since I've started working on potty training have I put the genie away.I used both the original genie and later upgraded to the improved genie and found it much easier to use.  Both were very convenient to use though and the diaper sausage system really eliminated odors.I remember going to my girlfriends house and the whole house smelled like pee because she put her diapers in the trash.  For me, my genie was really convenient and it eliminated odors.  I loved only having to take the genie out once a week or so.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"Overall, I think the Diaper Genie is a good product.  It's pretty easy to use and refill.  I don't think it will be good at keeping the odors concealed once my daughter starts solids.  Right now it doesn't contain the smell of breastfed waste.  Her nursery smells like butter when I walk in.  And I change the Genie at least twice a week.My biggest complaint is not so much the smell, but that you have to push the diaper through to a level before it actually seals the dirty diaper.  Pushing a full diaper home is not my idea of fun.I was in IKEA one day, in the changing room and the diaper pail in there was a pleasure to use.  You just put the diaper in a hole and the top rotates and viola!!  It's gone!  No need to touch anything.",4,1
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"First of all, I appreciate all the reviews here that were definitely helpful to my decision making process.  My review here is to serve the same purpose - helping new parents to make clear and good decision:- Pro: works great, keeps the smell inside, holds about 1 week of diapers, easy to use.- Con: like many have said - use Genie's plastic bags, the cutter doesn't give a clean cut of bag sometimes. Another issue I had with was the first few diapers might get stuck together since the bag wasn't twisted well enough to hold them separately.  This requires additional attention to push extra bag down to give room for the twist.",4,1

KidCo Adjustable Locking Strap - White,"While searching for something to keep our 15 month old safe from pinched fingers on our lazy susan, I only found 2 safety devices available.

Traffic Light Lamp,"This light is fun. I origionally got it because I thought it would be a cool night light but it says on warning sticker not to leave it on for more than 2 hours at a time.

Maybe I'm too easily amused but I thought it was awsome for such a small light.",5,1

Deluxe Snuggle Nest - Blue Patchwork,"I bought this Snuggle Nest on a whim for occasional use, but on the first night I was home after the birth and had to keep getting up and reaching down to get Jack out of the crib every 2 hours, I thought I would try it out.  We have been using it for over a month now, and he loves it.  The hospital had recommended, on the advice of SIDS Australia, to keep the baby in your room with you for 6 months, and not in a crib in another room, as it is important for the baby to hear you breathing in order to 'remember' to breathe.  I had intended to have the crib next to us as we have an open plan apartment - I imagine many people could not fit one in their room - but this is a fine substitute (we do have a King bed though).  The side wedges are adjustable in width with velcro - I get them snug around his hips so he wouldn't be able to get in a bad position.  I just lift him out and put him on my Boppy pillow to nurse - very comfortable.  The light is great as when I put him down he spits up some milk every time and if I was putting him in a crib I don't know if I would even know this until he started crying.  My husband would not feel comfortable co-sleeping without this - he doesn't seem to wake at the slightest baby noise like I do.  Sometimes when I put Jack in the Snuggle Nest he is not asleep but I can rest my head next to it and look at him and close my eyes, and he closes his eyes in imitation and it helps him sleep.  Basically, co-sleeping is not contraindicated by SIDS researchers - they have a number of caveats though (if you smoke, are drunk, have many pillows/covers, a soft mattress, etc).  This Snuggle Nest keeps the covers and pillow safely away from the baby and keeps the baby from rolling toward you (important if you are heavy) or you from rolling onto him.  My husband is over 200 lbs and if the baby was lying next to him without this, the mattress would sag towards him and the baby would probably roll.  The Nest's mattress is firm which is recommended for babies (you can buy extra sheets for it as well).  Jack and I get more sleep not having to get out of bed.  I'll be sorry when he grows out of it but I hope I can transition him to the crib by putting this in the crib, as others have.  I hope this helps as I have found other people's reviews very valuable when shopping online for baby gear.",5,1
Deluxe Snuggle Nest - Blue Patchwork,I love this product.  I slept so much better knowing that my baby was in a safe area in my bed. I love the way the end is open so that nothing interferes with my access to the baby and it also allowed me to use the product longer since nothing was blocking my baby's growing legs!,5,1
Saddle Style Soaker Mattress Pad - Will Absorb 6 Cups of Liquid - Made in America (34&quot; X 36&quot;),"We really liked this product, but just be careful to make sure you have it centered (top and bottom) properly. It was working great for us, until last night my daughter crawled under it as a blanket and coincidentally had an accident that morning! We will make sure that it is pulled up high enough so that she isn't able to do that in the future. Other than that it is so easy to pull off and switch in the middle of the night while still keeping the bottom sheet dry since you are typically half asleep when these things happen. ;)",4,1
Saddle Style Soaker Mattress Pad - Will Absorb 6 Cups of Liquid - Made in America (34&quot; X 36&quot;),"I ordered two of these mattress pad overlays for my eight year old daughter who still has a bed wetting problem and often has leaky pull ups at night.  Prior to getting these pads, I was often up 2-3 times a week changing sheets at 2am.  These pads have been a lifesaver for me and have also given my daughter a bit more independence in dealing with her accidents.  She is able to change the pad easily along with her jammies and go back to bed without having to ask for help. She has appreciated having these pads as it makes her feel like ""she can do it"" by herself without having to ask for help with changing her sheets.  I wish I would have ordered these years ago.

Baby Trend Galaxy Travel System,although my baby isnt born yet.... i have two other kids and have always had a horrible time with the stroller... not turning smoothly... hard to fold and unfold... car seat not fitting in it properly.... but THIS stroller/carseat combo is the BEST....  i put it on my registry and was disapointed to see that i could only get it online.... i was worried about leaving it as a shower gift because THIS is the set i wanted after all the reviews i read about it.. i HAD to have it... i love the triangle handle.. very comfortable to carry the car seat.. i love that the way you fold up the stroller is so easy... the plastic pieces DO slam on floor when i fold it though and that worries me.... i dont want to break it or totally ruin them the first time i use it out side of the house... other than that.. i love that it turns SO smooth.. the stroller glides around like its on air.. not all bumpy and horrible.... the overall look is beautiful.. it looks like it would be easy to clean up when baby spits up all over and or diaper leaks.... i am VERY impressed with this product and im VERY glad i decided to buy it myself and not just HOPE someone else would get it as a gift.. THIS is the one i wanted...and i love it... although if i didnt have access to my husbands debit card.... i wouldnt have been able to purchase it... so the ONLY complaint i have about this is that i couldnt buy it in the store....  babies r us  had the same brand of stroller .. but it wasnt THIS one....oh and i just remembered a concern i had about this stroller..... it has a plastic clip to keep the stroller folded... i really feel it shouldnt be plastic.. and if it HAS to be plastic.. it shouldnt be flexible like this one is... but still  overall.. i love this product...and if this one flew away in a hurricane.. i would definitely get this one again... i would recomend this to anyone..,5,1
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original- Midnight Blue,"The Baby Bjorn is extremely well designed and it has been one of the most useful things we registered for. My daughter is cranky in her stroller and in the infant car seat but she loves being toted around in the Baby Bjorn. I take her for a walk every evening and she just loves looking around and the rocking motion. She even naps in it if I'm shopping and she's no longer interested in the sights! I am sooo glad we paid the $90 for it. It's been a life saver!I can imagine that once the baby is over 15 lbs, he/she may have to graduate to a backpack or something else but till they are too heavy, this is THE way to carry a baby!",5,1

Fisher-Price Dance Baby Dancin Band,My son pulled up to a stand for the first time on this toy. He loves the red monkey and just had to have it. I was so proud! I think the toy really does encourage pulling up. And for that I think its great. My son is mostly interested in the monkey. He always grabs it and it does make a bad clicking sound but the toy appears to be very durable and it has taken many a beating. He also loves to play with the guitar but he could care less about the horns or the lighted keys. All in all I think this is a great toy if you get it for a gift but I dont think I would have bought it myself.,4,1
Fisher-Price Dance Baby Dancin Band,"This toy is a big hit in my home!It was purchased for my daughter that has a rare form of dwarfism and the height was perfect for her! Also it has two volume settings which helped with her hearing issues. The toy is also very bright and lights up for any vision concerns. Overall this is a great toy for a child develomentally delayed or for those right where they should be. Even my three year old played with it regularly. Also, my children stopped the monkey countless times from spinning and it still works in perfect condition.",5,1
Fisher-Price Dance Baby Dancin Band,"I bought this toy for the sole purpose of my son learning to stand.  I must say first off that this toy has a wide strong base (legs) and is heavy enough that my son was *immediately* able to pull himself up, pull on it, push on it, and half stand, all without the toy budging.I am very happy with the strength of this toy, but, as mentioned in other reviews, this toy is REALLY SHORT!  It works &#34;OK&#34; for my son as he's very short for his age (10 mos &#60; 5%) but I can see that he will grow out of this toy within probably 2 months.Regrettably, I'm bring the toy back.  Again, as others have said, the first thing he went for is the monkey, and almost broke it.  Also, because the music can be triggered by just about anything, including standing on the mat, it almost never shuts off.  I can turn the volume down, of course, but the point is supposed to be that the BABY does or touches something to make the music go.  I don't see how he'll associate him doing an action to turn the music on if it never really stops.So I think this toy would be great in the right circumstances, but unfortunately not for my son.",4,1

I originally purchased two, since I knew that I might lose them for whatever reason (i.e., inadvertently dropped or forgotten at a restaurant).  Indeed, I did lose one at a mall, and I had to purchase a new one to replace the ""runaway"" dog.My baby cuddles up with it when he goes to sleep.  In fact, I can see how happy my baby gets when he sees Spunky.  He would reach for it, grab it by the tail or ears, and hug it to sleep.  Sometimes, my baby would bite Spunky's tail or nose, and carry it with his mouth while crawling on the floor.  It's a very cute and lovely image.This item gives a good value for its price.  The fact that my baby seems to love it says it all.",5,1
"Gund Baby Spunky Plush Puppy Toy Small, Tan",Super soft. It's been my daughters favorite since she was an infant. Luckily we purchased 2 so we have a backup if needed. Washes well and barking mechanism lasted through frequent machine washing and drying. Now doesn't bark anymore but my 2 yr old daughter still loves him. So cute ;),5,1
"Gund Baby Spunky Plush Puppy Toy Small, Tan","Soft and cute. I will say, I thought it would be a little bigger and stuffed a bit more full, but my daughters just adore this puppy. The other reason I didn't give the complete 5 stars is because the bark button isn't easy to activate.",4,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,"We bought the Roundabout back in 2000, after the Evenflo kept literally breaking on us. We've always been glad we bought it. It was a lot of $, but so worth it - I wish Britax would lower their price, but they see us all say it's worth it.  Anyway, the one thing I really liked about this seat is that the cover is washable. However for some reason, their newer car seats' covers are only hand washable, which I feel is a very bad move; a great disservice. If baby's diaper leaks or baby spits up/vomits, you want to stick it in the washer and dryer and get it over with.  Now we're forced to spend $40 to $60 for a backup cover. Good move for Britax's bottom line, but not ours.  The other problem we had is that it did tip, but I think that was more from my hubby not installing it correctly, although it should really be idiot proof.  One day we were driving down a mountain and ds was wild, rocking his seat back and forth.  We heard ""Uh oh"" coming from the back seat and found he was laying on his side in the seat. Hubby tethered it then and stopped the problem. DS is now almost six years old and says it's still comfortable. I wish their seats had footrests. He could put his food up on the bottom rung of the seat, which I don't think the newer seats have.  We were going to move my 6 mo. old dd into his seat, but were advised that you should not use seats that are over 6 years old, as the straps, plastic and foam break down, along with it being old technology. We went ahead and bought the huge Marathon instead because it will go up to 65lb, not 40 like the new Roundabouts.  Our next move is to get a new seat for our six year old, which will probably be the Britax booster seats. One note: I really like the way the old Roundabout latch button worked - on top of the latch, rather than a button in the middle as is on the Marathon.  I love the new softness of the suede-like covers.",5,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,"My husband and I knew very little about carseats and early on in our research we kept hearing that Britax seats were the best.  In the end we bought the Roundabout and we could not be happier!  Our son grew too tall for his infant carrier at the ripe old age of 4 months so we needed a convertable seat for him earlier than anticipated.  The Roundabout is plush and comfrotable, not to mention being one of the safest seats on the market.  I drive a VW Jetta and the seat fits nicely in the middle.  The rest of the backseat is tight but getting two more people in there is doable.  We have a Graco Comfortsport in our other car and while our son likes both seats, there is a huge difference between the two.  The Roundabout was fairly easy to install and it is easy to adjust the straps.I love it and would but another in a heartbeat.",5,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,"I am an over neurotic first time mom that doesn't even buy diapers without researching them first.  I spent countless hours on the internet researching what would be the most important purchase for my son.  After trying out the Evenflo Triumph Deluxe (highly recomended by consumer report) which isn't worth the plastic it is made from, i bought the Britax Roudabout.  I HIGHLY recomend this wonderful car seat.  It is very easy to install and my son has not complained once since we made the switch.  The cover comes off easily to wash and the straps are very easy to adjust and fit my sons body perfectly.  I had a car seat safety check officer go over my seat, and he told how happy he was to see that i had the Britax, that it was the best car seat on the market. In this case you definitely get what you pay for.  Hope this helped.",5,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,This carseat is the best carseat.  I wish their infant carseat was as big of a hit.  It is worth the money!!,5,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,"This is the best car seat. I've been through a lot between 3 of my own kids and nannying others.  This is so easy to install.  It's rated above any others in crash test and in recalls.  The straps do not twist -- by this I mean that at the shoulders or in the fastening clips the straps are too thick to get twisted round and round like the others seats do.  I was always struggling to get the straps evened out and facing the right direction in our infant seat.  The only reason I didn't buy this seat sooner is that I got an awesome deal on the stoller/car seat combo and it came with a 2nd base so I waited until baby was 10 months before I just had to go out and get the Britax.  The belly pad is great not only for the hot days but also if you have a plump little pot bellied baby (like my little buddah) it's nice to know you're not near to pinching him or her.If I had to come up with a negative it would be the instruction manual being strapped to the seat but that could be a plus too if you need to see how to put it in an airplane or need to remember how to set it for rear facing at a later date.  Who knows where those instruction manuals go after the baby is born :)Although it's high priced, if you think about getting roughly 4 years of use out of it then really it's nothing...I'll spend more on Starbucks in the next year!Good luck to the shoppers out there compairing.  I haven't found one better.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I buy this so i can have my son in only one area clean and secure to play...The Best i recomend this product..My son like it to. We have labrador retriever and he like to play with my son's toys so this is perfect for us.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","This play yard is great. It is light weight and easy to use. I read a lot of negative reviews about how hard it was to take the panels apart, but it was surprisingly easy. As far as the weight of this thing, my three year old can carry it to the car. It contained the younger kids perfectly and gave them lots of room to play. I would recommend this to anyone.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","This play yard is great for your pets.  We bought two and combined them for our two dogs (about 55lbs each) and it gives them a nice area to play in without having the run of the house.  If push came to shove, they would be able to get out which is nice, too.  I would recommend this product to any dog owner for a good size play area.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I bought 2 of these play yards (joined them together to form 1 large area)for my 9 month old daughter to have enough room to run around our family room without getting into the T.V. stand drawers and wandering into the kitchen and other unsafe areas. It works great!!! Well, other than the fact that she cries when no one is in there with her :-/ but nonetheless, the play yard met my expectations.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I bought this for my daughter who has a 1 yr old and 18 mo old AND is expecting another. She is very happy with the superyard as it keeps the kids contained so she can do things nearby. The kids actually seem to enjoy their special play area too. We also got the extension which makes it a very nice area for the children.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","As other reviewers mention, no it's not beautiful.  But I definitely did not buy it for it's beauty.  I bought it along with an extension set to have a safe area for our children to play.  It's much roomier than a playpen, but still can be folded up to be mobile if needed.  It absolutely does get scooted all over our hardwood floor, but I'm ok with that.  It still keeps her from going through doors or opening up cabinets.  Most of the time, we let her run free in the house, but this is so fantastic if she wants to watch TV while I'm making dinner or just give her some boundaries while running around.  It is quite difficult to get the ends together, but I can do it without my husband's help.  With our first child, we used it also around the Christmas tree and around her bed to keep her from wandering if she woke up and I didn't hear her.  For these two jobs, we left it as an open semi-circle, but it's never gotten toppled over for us.  We just used the strongest/most stable angles at each joint.  Overall, this is wonderful, and one day, we may even use it as a puppy pen outside.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I am so glad I decided to purchase this!!  It works wonders for my little crawler.  I bought the 2 panel extension kit to go along with it so he has so much room to roam.  I put him in it with all of his toys and he will play for hours and I don't have to worry about him getting hurt.  It is very sturdy and has not been knocked over and he has even pulled himself up to a standing position while holding on to it and it stood strong!!  Definitely worth the money!!  I may buy another extension for it when he starts walking so it will definitely last for a while.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Ordered this yard online at Amazon. It came with 5 sections connected. All you have to do is to unfold all sections and connect the last link. The installation was very easy but noisy (when you unfold it some sections click loudly). My baby is 11 months old, he leans on the yard walls pretty often. And the yard is strong enough to hold him. Baby doesn't feel separated by the yard and can be left alone for a few moments.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","This product is extremely good and very useful....well constructed, good design and very sturdy.  Either used as a confined play area, or as barrier against areas you want to corner off from the child.  Highly recommend this product.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Very sturdy. Good quality. Find it hard to open and close it though, takes a lot of pressure and I feel like I'm going to break it every time I do it.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I give this item 20 stars. I put the purchase off for a while. With twin boys, I needed it. It is a lifesaver, truly. It sets my mind at ease when I have things to do.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I got this for my grandson.  At eight months, he is able to push the sides and move it across the floor.  He almost pushed it down the other day.  That being said, It still proves useful in containing him for play and gives him more freedom that a play pen.  I would not leave him alone in it as I would be afraid he would push it down and fall.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","My wife and I bought this product for our 8 month old son, who regardless of how much we baby proof still manages to get into everything. It wasn't expensive at all compared to similar products. Our son is a big boy (24 lbs 26 inches long), and we were afraid that he would hurt himself by pulling up on it, but it seems to stand just fine with his weight. WE needed the peace of mind knowing that he wouldn't get into something dangerous while we were washing bottles, cooking dinner, cleaning house, ect... We're so happy we bought this, you wont be disappointed!",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",Thank you.  I wasn't expected two day shipping. It was awesome and this play yard is very strong enough to wiggle by baby.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Awesome product!!! I absolutely love this to my baby. However,  I highly suggest also purchasing the extension piece that is sold separately.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",My son loves it! And I feel safe running to the kitchen to get a soda now that he's up and running all over! A must-have for parents with small children who have just started walking.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Overall this product is as described and I am satisfied with the purchase.  The only flaw is if you use it to block something rather than using it as a playpen.  There is a small plastic knob at the bottom of each section that is used to connect them together, so when the gate is not connected it is sticking straight up in the air and a child could easily fall on it a get seriously hurt.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I bought this play yard years ago for a new puppy, it was invaluable...after I lent it to a relative, I never saw it again.  Years later I have now purchased this for my first grandson...again I find it invaluable.Once he started to crawl, this became a safe haven for him and a way for me to get a break from running after him.  He liked using the honeycomb lattice to pull himself up and walk around the parameter of the gate.After a while I used the gate in pieces...I used a three section piece to keep him safe from my wood burning stove...now keep in mind it was not all that stable but it kept him from getting burnt and if he did knock it over and it fell on him it was light enough to not hurt him.  I used a two section piece to keep him away from an artificial tree in a corner of the living room...and sometimes used a 2 or three section piece to block off an entry way...again not all that stable but it does deter and if it does come down on them it wont cause any harm in my experience.The unit folds up nicely for storage and has a very sturdy canvas strap with two snaps that can be used as a handle for carrying around.Breaking the sections apart are not all that easy...you need a bit of muscle but I was able to handle it on my own.With the ease and compactness of storage, I highly recommend this unit...if you have any small children in your home or those who may be visiting, this unit will be invaluable to you.  I have many North States products...gates and such and find them to be well made and worth the price.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","It works quite well.  I think I would like it better as one color, but the baby loves the different colors!",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Of course my seven year old is my best helper, but this Superyard is #2.  I used this product for my other two grandkids and it provided me a a great sense of security.  I use mine in a rectangle shape so it doesn't take up the entire living room.  My new grandbaby is not too thrilled with it, but he will get used to it.The product is easy enough to fold when the kids leave and doesn't take up much space.All in all, I love it and I will reiterate, I love the sense of security it provides.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Great for keeping our 1 year old daughter safe. We originally ordered 1, then ordered a second so we had enough to cover the perimeter of the living room. It gives us peace of mind knowing she can't get near the TV or fireplace.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I bought this play pen for my small dog. It's big enough so that he has plenty of room to sleep, play, and even do his business in there. The play pen is easy to fold up if I ever need to put it away. The hinges are a little ridged, but maybe it still needs to be twisted and turned a bit more. It comes with these rubber stickers to put on the bottom so the play pen won't slide. Since I use it for my dog, he tends to get the panels dirty. So I have to wipe it down everyday. It can get difficult with all the little holes and crevices on each panel. But overall, the play pen is very sturdy. My dog can't move it or tip it over.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",These are GREAT for blocking/sectioning off large areas that are too awkward or tricky to really baby proof. We are military and move a lot so I don't like to invest in a million baby proofing gates that I don't know if I'll need in 6 months. This has worked out perfectly for a certain area of our house. Definitely recommend!,4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","The main kit is big enough for my 10 month-old to play in adequate space in my living room, but not overwhelming in size for my small living room. It's strong and sturdy, though a bit industrial-looking. Overall, I'm very pleased!",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",This was a little difficult for my husband and I to put together but we managed finally.  We have a small living room and it takes up quite a chunk of space.  Its great for putting all baby's toys in one area.  My problem is that my seven month old is now pulling herself up to stand and can push on the walls and move it on the wood floor.  I'm pretty sure she will soon be able to move it a lot further across the room.  The thick play mats underneath have helped keep it in one place for now at least.  I would've liked to see some kind of door on it - a little hard on the back to reach in and get baby out if baby's in the middle.  Yes I realize I could step over it but I have short legs and definitely not as nimble as I used to be.  Would also like it if it came in different colors so it didn't look so much like a dog kennel.,4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",This is a mothers savior.  I can actually do the dishes without running after my little whos crawled over to something she is not supposed to be into. She loves it since it is much bigger than a playpen.  We have tile so we went out and got an area rug to put in on.  Works great.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Our granddaughter needed a place to play safely, this is what we bought for her.  It's good because you can use all of the pieces or just a few, depending on how you want to set it up.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I bought two of these to keep my one year old away from things.  One is around the Christmas tree and the other I split into two sections to keep her away from the fireplace and my records (she loved to wave them around and put them all on the floor).  I anchored them to the wall so they stay in place well.  She likes to throw her toys over them sometimes but other than that she ignores them.  They do a great job of keeping her away from things.  I wouldn't use them to put her in because I like to let her have the run of the house except for the areas she shouldn't get into.  They aren't very nice looking but they work well for what I'm using them for.,4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We are using this product for our duck when we want to have him indoors. He is small and cannot fly, so this enclosure works perfectly for him. This product has worked great for us, is a nice size and easy to move. The only problem we have had is the mechanism that is used to lock/unlock the gate requires a lot of strength to operate. Other than that it is a great product for anything that you want to keep in a certain area, as long as the occupent is not strong enough to move it or climb over it. It would be especially good for many types of pets.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",We purchased this for our puppy that we getting. It has worked wonderful for helping w/housebreaking. Our puppy also likes it when she can get away from our youngest child.,5,1
Tomy Walker Bike,"We got this as a hand-me-down from my sister when my son was quite young. It sat in the corner until he started to pull up and cruise at about 9 months. First he loved to play with the panel with the phone (especially) and the rotating snail. When he got better at cruising, he liked to push the walker on a carpeted surface. Now at 11 months (not yet walking) he loves to push it up and down a long wood-floored hallway. He just gets a huge smile whenever he walks with it! The toy is very well built, and not flimsy like some other walker toys. I also like that we can reassemble it as a ride-on toy later and get more use as he gets older. I'm surprised at how reasonably priced it is.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"This was a great monitor, worked so well.The screen picture stopped working after we dropped it a few too many times (after about 3 years) - then we used it for sound.If we were upstairs and my son was in bed but sick, or if we were outside.It just now completely died and my son is 5 1/2.That was definitley worth the money and a great product, gave us more years than I expected.  :)",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"I definitely wanted a video monitor, because my bedroom is upstairs and the baby is downstairs.  Having a video monitor is great because you can check if the baby's awake or just squawking in his sleep before you go all the way in there.  I've tried three: this one, the Mobi Cam, and the new Safety First version.  Both the other two got constant static that caused the picture to flicker and a clicking sound to come through on the audio.  This one is USUALLY static free, accept for a periodic BLARE, usually in the middle of the night. It's pretty frustating, but I've now found a low enough volume level whereby the static won't scare me out of bed when it hits but I can still hear if my son cries.As for the other features, the ""color"" is pretty poor, but the night vision works fairly well.  It's very nice that it's portable, and that you don't HAVE to mount the camera--you can place it on a flat surface and angle it to see.  I also like that when it's unplugged, the video shuts off after a couple minutes so it doesn't drain your battery.  Then you can pop it back on (or off) with the touch of a big button on top.  When it's plugged in, the video will stay on all night, but I feel like it starts to get warm when I leave the picture on too long.  I generally shut it off until he makes noise, then I turn on the picture to see what's going on down there.Since I've tried THREE video monitors, and this worked the best in my house, I thought I'd pass the research along.",4,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"I wish I had gotten this from the very beginning of my daughter's birth.  She is currently 8 months.  We just got it recently because we have been doing some sleep training with her where we were letting her cry for a while.  The video monitor makes the training so much easier to handle as a mother.  I also enjoy just watching my baby sleep which was something that I was able to do when she was a newborn when nothing could wake her up, but now I am too scared to wake her up with any slight noise I make if I went in her room.  It is also nice for babysitters so they feel more assured by noises they may hear from the baby's room.  The grandparents feel like they got to see her even though she is only sleeping.I definitely recommend this if you can afford the splurge.  This particular model the screen is nice and big but I've also tried the 1.8"" one and it was fine too.  Actually the 1.8"" one had slightly better video quality.  The color does not work on either one unless the room is very brightly lit (the manual notes this too), so unless you have a baby who doesn't mind sleeping in a bright room, you won't ever see color.One function I find lacking is a screen brightness option.  It is really bright and hard on the eyes when you flip it on in the middle of the night to see what is going on with the baby.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"We bought this monitor with some debate due to it's cost and some of the negative reviews that were on Amazon.  But we decided to take our chances and get it.  We are very glad that we did.This monitor has been a trooper.  Our little guy is over a year old now and not only did this monitor survive some superficial roughing up when he got hold of it, but we are very sure we could use this for our second child if we have one.  The battery is still the original that came with it and it has never died on us even when left on for a hours at a time.  We leave it on and unplugged when he's napping and when he goes to bed up until the time we go to bed, a good four to five hours.The picture clarity is great when there is enough light, but when it gets dark it can be a bit hard to see the baby in the crib, but you CAN see them.  Hey it's a low grade form of night vision, what do you expect?  There is very little static and the picture comes through anywhere in the house and even outside the house; noting we have a poured concrete and steel house, wireless internet and 900 and 2.4 Mhz cordless phones.  These things do not deter the transmission of the picture.The fact that you can attach this monitor to your side is a plus as well.  And getting a video monitor is so much better because you don't have to walk into the room to check on your baby and disturb it's sleep.  Or, god forbid, wake the little monster.  They need their sleep...and so do you.  All I can say to those who had issues with their units is that either they got a defective one,  or they didn't read the directions.  We are very happy with this monitor and it's performance and would certainly buy it again.  Very much worth the money.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"My baby, at 2 months, had no problem transitioning from our room to his room...it was ME who had the problem. With this video monitor, my mind was completely at ease. Not only is the audio reception much better than the audio monitors we have, being able to see what he was doing in his crib was SO helpful. At night I would watch him for a while on the video, and make sure he was sound asleep...then I would press the button on top which shuts off the video part, and I would leave the audio monitor on. If I heard a noise in the middle of the night, I could just hit the top of the monitor (like an alarm clock snooze button) and see what was up. It's great. Highly recommended.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"Our first monitor was just for sound, but every time we'd hear somethhing, you had to go and check. With this monitor, if you hear something, all you have to do is look at the video to see if you need to go in the room. I was worried with the negative reviews I read for this product, but it works great for us. You can strap the monitor to your belt, and get some things done around the house. The video in the dark is great. The monitor is color, but you'll only see that if your room is brightly lit.",4,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"When my first child was born, I thought I didn't need a video monitor...until he started rolling around in his bed, and eventually climbing out.  Now he's 2 and I just purchased this to keep an eye on him as he gets out of bed on his own now, and for our new baby that's on the way.  Can't believe I didn't get one of these sooner!  Picture is clear in both dark and lighted room, sound quality is just as good if not better than any other monitor I've owned.  I love this monitor.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"We purchased this monitor last October because we wanted a video monitor for when we started sleep training our daughter.  Every time we would go into check on her, our squeaky upstairs floors would wake her up, or if she was just being quiet, it would distract her for us to walk in.  This monitor is perfect since it allows us to be able to see what's going on without actually walking in her room.  Now we use it just when she is stirring around to be sure that she is just moving around rather than being upset.  The image is very clear.  We do have some interference from the home phone and our neighbors car alarm, but otherwise it works wonderful.  The only downside we have encountered is the part of the charger that plugs into the device had trouble connecting.  I called Summer Infant's customer service and they are sending out a replacement charger for free.  That makes me even more happy with going with their brand.  I definitely recommend!",5,1
Musti Eau De Soin 3.38 fl oz,Just love this colonge.  So fresh and clean!  Smells like a wonderful clean baby. We go through theses bottles so quickly because I can't help wearing it myself!  You will love this scent.  The best baby colonge out there.  Much better than even the famous designer brands that cost 4 times more.  Trust me I've bought them all.  So happy to see that Amazon is offering this great product.  Usually you have to search exclusive boutiques that always run out of stock.  And it usually retails for $35-$40 Thank you Mustela nad Amazon!  Try the shampoo too it makes the colonge scent last longer.,5,1

Mustela 2-In-1 Hair &amp; Body Shampoo 6.76 ounces,"We have been using Mustela for almost two years and absolutely love it. It is a bit more expensive than all other brands. But, well worth it. A tiny dollop is all you need for a new and not much more for a toddler. I was so happy to find this item on Amazon since I can't seem to find it at Target any more. Must try it out.",5,1
Mustela 2-In-1 Hair &amp; Body Shampoo 6.76 ounces,"Okay, we are two guys and we don't have any experience with babies.  So when we had our daughter (by surrogacy) we got a lot of help.  This product line was one of the things we recieved and we use it all the time.  It smells fantastic, and people say it smells &#34;like a baby&#34;.  It works well, she likes having it put on her, and it cleans her up super good.  They also have a baby skin lotion that also smells the same, and works fantastically.  This is one of those secrets that you mom got from your grandmother, and they decided to let you in on it.  The product is golden!!!",5,1
Mustela 2-In-1 Hair &amp; Body Shampoo 6.76 ounces,This 2-in-1 is amazing.  The scent is wonderful...too bad they don't make it for adults :)  A very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike.  It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully.  I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn't Mustela.  Fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products.  Try them and you'll see why.,5,1
Mustela Massage Oil - 3.38 oz.,I love all mustela products. This message oil is not greasy a all and absorbs into baby skin very quickly.,5,1
"Friendly Toys Little Playzone Extension Kit, Single","I've already rated the playzone itself, but I'll add it here.  If you get the Lil' Playzone you really should invest in at least one of thease extensions or you might as well use your Pack n Play.  The playzone by itself is about the same size.  Its great for a larger safe area for your child, but take those bear stickers off, they dont stick well and my child peeled one off and started eating it!",4,1
Lamaze Octivity Time,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old daughter as an Easter present.  It's all I can do to not give it to her early (like she would know the difference).  This is an adorable toy, full of different sensory items for her to enjoy.  This face is precious.  I'm sure my daughter will have hours of fun with it!",5,1
Compass B500 Folding Booster Car Seat Color: Gold Dust,"We live in Manhattan and don't own a car... We have used the Sit 'n Stroll since our daughter was a baby (fantastic product), but she's outgrown it now and we needed something very portable and easy to store.  It's VERY easy to get in and out of the cab, easy for her to climb in and out of, and easy to strap her in.  City parents, take note!",5,1
Velour Boppy Nursing Pillow - green,"When I was pregnant I got a lot of mixed reviews as to whether I needed a boppy. I decided to go ahead and get one. I picked the sage green one because it was unisex. Let me just say it has been the most used item in my home since coming home with my son. I use it to breastfeed, I use it to prop my son up, I use it to give my son some tummy time, I use it when my arm feels like it is about to fall off but I can't bear to put my son down because he is too precious to let go of! It is such a life saver.  The green luxe cover is super soft and cozy and very easy to remove and wash!",5,1
Velour Boppy Nursing Pillow - green,"This was the best thing I received for my shower.  First of all, I used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital.  I used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area.  I could sit on the couch, in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication..THANKS BOPPY!!As for my son, I use it for him to sleep on while I'm doing housework.  I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.  I have only had to wash the pillow a few times, but it still looks brand new.BOPPY GETS MY ""CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT"" VOTE...A+++++++++++++***UPDATE...It also helped with my son sitting up.  I would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over.  It keeps going and going and going...",5,1
Playtex One-Step Breast Milk Storage Kit,"I purchased this at the same time I purchased the Playtex Embrace Pump.  I love the kit!  However, I see the down side to the other reviewers problems.  If you are thinking of purchasing the Embrace, this is a must have.  You will NOT need to purchase two kits to begin with because Platex makes the pump AND this kit and the pieces all fit together...no adapter necessary.  This will give you additional freezer storage capabilities, but only 4 liners at a time. (the reason for only 4 stars).  I see where the cost could add up for anyone not using the Playtex pump, but as far as ease of use...with the Embrace...it's a piece of cake!",4,1
Playtex One-Step Breast Milk Storage Kit,"I bought this product thinking that it would work well with the other playtex bottles, nipples, etc. that I already have.  It seems to be working out great.  I can pump using my Medela pump right into the storage receptacles and then put them right into the fridge.  If I'm on the run one afternoon, I grab one and go.  It's so easy and even the cleaning is easy.  Only a couple things to wash and you're done.  That means a lot to me when you're constantly cleaning other things around the house.  I'm one very happy customer.",5,1
Couture Bundle Me in Mocha Suede,"I registered for this item and received it as a shower gift.  My son was born in January and I have used it everyday since he was born.  It fits snugly around him and does not interfere with the car seat harness.  I was given two snow suits for him to wear and I never used them in the car seat because everything I read advised that you should not put your child in a car seat with bulky clothing because it makes it impossible to get a good tight fit.  It fits perfectly in the car seat and cushions him all around.  Because it zippers around him from the bottom he doesn't lose his shoes or socks etc.  It washes like a dream and looks as good now as it did when I got it.  Now that the weather is nicer, during the day I put him in it without the top piece zippered on and in the evening, when it is cooler, I zip the top piece back on and he stays warm and toasty.  I couldn't recommend this product any more highly!  I tell everyone about it!",5,1
MobiCam 70002 Indoor Camera,"We've had and used it for 2 years and it works great. We have a wireless system in our house and have no problems. It does have a little static when the microwave is on, but we don't put anything in there for more than 5 minutes. The only problem is I just can't stop watching her. We're going to buy another one for our little one because our first is still young enough where we want to still see her too.",5,1

"JL Childress 6 Bottle Cooler, Black","We tossed the ice pack that came with this and bought the Medela one.  We put 4 8 oz. Dr. Brown's bottles and the ice pack in this every day for day care.  Everything fits and stays cold.  The top portion is large enough for a couple of bibs, or a note from the daycare plus a onesie that got spit up on, or quite a few teething rings.  We use this daily and are very pleased with it.",5,1
"JL Childress 4 'N 1 Car Seat Travel System, Black","We bought two of these for our Britax Marathon car seats and I was pleased to find that it easily fit them with room to spare.  The bag has two heavy zippers which extend completely around the bag so that you can fully pull down the front flap for easy loading of the car seat.  The bag itself is thick and stood up to airline and rental car abuse.  The only marginal down side is that the bag can be a little bulky when not in use.  I have high hopes of getting it folded back into the small plastic bag that it came in, but that seems rather unlikely without a detailed folding schematic.",5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle","After much searching and trying to decide what to do for our upcoming baby girl, my husband and I absolutely fell in love when we saw this bassinet. We knew our little one just had to have it and the price was unbeatable! I couldn't wait for it to arrive! As soon as it did, my Mom and I tore into it and put it together. I asssembled it by myself, since I couldn't wait for my husband to get home, and it only took my about 30 minutes. It was very easy. It is even more beautiful in person than the picture online. I love, love, love it and I can't wait to put my baby girl in it when she arrives.",5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",The bassinet is as the picture shows it! Colors match exactly to picture. I have not used it yet since I'm not due for another 3 months but I'd definitely recommend it!,5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",Bought this as a gift. Different than a regular bassinet. Easy to assemble. Has a nice storage area underneath. Perfect for a princess.,5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",A TWO pack of white sheets to fit the round bassinet are available at Target or [...] for $24.99.  You can also buy the sheets and add a little bit of fabric dye to easily change the color to match anything in baby's room.  Good luck everyone!!!,4,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle","I purchased this for my unborn daughter so I can't give accurate testimony on how well it will hold up. It arrived timely and I was satisfied with what I got, at the price I paid. Assembly wasn't too bad (although all I did was watch until it was time to put the ruffles on), The bedding is mediocre but that was to be expected. I do wish the mattress pad were thicker and I'm on the hunt for round sheets now...",4,1

I wish I could find more things by cutie pie baby because the stuff they make is really fun. I have several of their got milk line and I really enjoy those too.  Anyway as the other reviewer said, this box has everything.  You can't go wrong with it.",5,1
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"Good product, only thing I don't like is the ounces aren't marked true to volume. The bag barely holds 5 ounces.",4,1
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I love Medela Pump & Save breastmilk bags! I especially love the new adapter! I know many were upset that the old bags were not compatible with all Medela breas pumps, but I believe this one covers them all! I would hate to have to transfer milk from a container to a bag. I'm already washing enough things; PLEASE don't add one more thing for me to wash! Medela listened! I will use these for a long time. The only down side is that I wish they had 8 ounce bags instead of just the 5 ounce bags. Bottles usually come in 4 ounces or 8 ounces and I wish medela would have their bags be the same way.",5,1
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,I've used these bags for both of my children.  They are easy to use and store milk well.  The hole for pouring out the milk is very convenient.,5,1
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"Love these storage bags. My daughter takes 3-4 oz at a time, so I am able to freeze smaller portions. I have not had trouble with leaking on the zip loc seal. Will definitely buy again!",5,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"For my second baby I received the My Brestfriend pillow as a gift and love it! My older child is only 16 months older - so I had to jump up and tend to her while still trying to nurse the baby - this pillow snaps on and stays in place. You can move to another room if need be. The boppy pillow would never stay close enough around my waist, the baby would always fall between the pillow and my lap, with this pillow it fits securley around you and holds it's shape. Highly reccommend it to a nursing mom.",5,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"this is the best nursing pillow i've found. love that it wraps all the way around, has a large surface area for me to rest my arm w/baby and that it has a mechanism for securing it around me and tightening/loosening it as needed. a must have for us long waisted nursing moms.",5,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"I went to a nursing store and tried several different pillows and this was the only one that was truly comfortable and not awkward to use.  My only complaint is that you cannot take it off in the same room in which your baby has fallen asleep... the velcro is LOUD!  LOL!  Otherwise, I can't imagine bf-ing without this pillow.",4,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"I originally thought I could do without a nursing pillow and just use regular pillows.  After all, it was a bit on the expensive side.  After my son was born and struggling to feed him in the first two days, my husband went out and bought this pillow.  It made my life so much easier!!!  If you are a new mother and your new born has trouble latching on, the last thing you want to do is trying to deal with 2 or 3 pillows that don't stay around you and slip away constantly.  Not only dose this pillow stay put while you position your infant, it provides back support for the mother, and the infant has an easy time to stay on the flat surface!I have to say that this is the best purchase I've made for my baby and I!  I would recommand it to any nursing mother.",5,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"I've nursed my little one several times with both My Brest Friend and with a boppy. I wish I had My Brest Friend at the very beginning - it's much easier to situate the little one appropriately, the back support for mom is GREAT, and the removable washable cover is very convenient. It's much easier to use than a boppy, and doesn't slide around. My only complaint is that the glue the manufacturer uses to keep the two foam pieces together is a little stinky. When mine arrived, I left it sitting out of the cover for a full day before I felt the fumes had dissipated enough for me not to worry about what the baby was breathing in. And I washed the cover a few times before using, too.",4,1
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"My son has acid reflux and feeding was hard enough as it was, let alone having to have my husband hold the Boppy so that it wouldn't slip away from my body.  The velcro (though loud to take off if the baby falls asleep) on the Brest Friend and the back support are a FABULOUS pairing.I've loaned this to 2 other friends who also tossed out their Boppies for the Brest Friend, and I won't even bother with the Boppy when my second arrives this spring.",5,1
Galt Playnest - Jungle,"This ""nest"" was bigger than I thought.  Baby sits in it nicely and seems to enjoy it very much.  If you purchase this, just remember not to blow the tube up first thing (it will not fit in the cloth liner slot - found out the hard way).  I think this thing is neat!",5,1
"Burlington Baby Moses Basket with Liner, White","This is a great basket for the price. It seems sturdy enough for the amount of time I will be using it. I didn't care what the bedding looked like because I was planning on making my own, but it really isn't too bad looking- it is fairly simple and fit the basket. I'm using the basket without any liner, just the mattress and sheet, and it's adorable. I paired it with a rocking Moses basket stand (also at a great price on Amazon) and it is just what I wanted- something simple and natural looking, not frilly or plastic.",4,1
Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus,"I have used several other massage devices but Medi-rub is hands down the best! Very easy to use and simple to put away when not in use. I am currently using it 2-3 times a day on low, have NOT had any feet cramps. Hope it will make a difference with the neuropathy in a few more weeks!",5,1
Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus,"I have bad ankles since birth , this product is amazing . I have tried other products that were a scam . this really works I only wish I had it 30 years ago",5,1
Medi-Rub Foot Massager 2000 Plus,"After experiencing this machine at my foot reflexologist's office today, I came to this page to check the price. If it was affordable I would buy one this instant. (It's definitely worth the money if you have the ability to pay.)My reflexologist put me on the Medi-Rub machine to get me warmed up for my treatment. She didn't do that for my first appointment and I could tell the difference. It really got my circulation going big-time. The reflexology treatment then seemed to ""follow"" the increased circulation up my legs and into my pelvis. It also increased the relaxation aspect of the treatment considerably.I use a wooden footsie roller at home for a general tonic effect on my feet (a quick, non-specific burst of reflexology is what I'm looking for during my busy schedule). This now seems like a caveman tool. I thought the roller effect was pretty darn wonderful until I experienced the Medi-Rub Foot Massager. Even on ""low"" (there are only two speeds - high and low) this machine puts my humble footsie roller in the shade within 15 seconds when it comes to sheer stimulation.The Medi-Rub is also more comfortable and less awkward. I can sit back in an armchair and allow the tilt of the footpad to support me, instead of perching on the edge of a chair and running in place on the rollers. The ""running in place"" action makes my back ache, whereas the Medi-Rub Massager doesn't require a straining posture of any kind. You don't have to do anything but close your eyes and let the bliss happen.This is an excellent therapeutic device, but it's also a superb way to get completely relaxed in the space of a few minutes. I've moved this little beauty to the top of my birthday wish list.P.S. The product photo is absurd - anyone using this machine while wearing business shoes is a looney toon.P.P.S. I take that back! I visited the manufacturer's Website (medirub.com in Texas) and found out you can use it either while wearing shoes or barefoot.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"I was having a hard time getting my 2 1/2 year old son to sit at the table for ANY meal.  So I thought a booster would be the ticket.....I was right!!  And the Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat was the perfect choice!  It gives him the lift he needs to feel part of the family, and the security and comfort to stay seated with us, even if he's finished his meal.  The orange is also a great compliment with the earthy decor in our house!!  I looked at a lot of these and kept coming back to this one.  Wipes easily, just perfect!!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,This booster seat works well. The seat doesn't slide around on the wooden chair even though there is no fasters holding it to the chair. My son is constantly in motion so i am really impressed. Easy to clean and my son seems to find it comfortable.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,This seat was exactly what I was looking for. My son is really tall to the seats with bars across the legs just don't work for him. Now he wants to sit no where else! It is a rubbery material to so it's comfortable for him and not easy to tear up or break. It also has little grips on the bottom that help it stay on the chair.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"I was worried about getting this vs. the more expensive Cushee, but am glad I didn't fork out the extra money. This seat is very durable, doesn't tip over (no matter how weirdly my son climbs in), cleans easily and looks good too. Highly recommended.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"This booster seat is just what I wanted.  It works great when my two-year-old granddaughter comes over and it's easy to store when she's not here.  It has been very safe and secure, doesn't move at all when she climbs up or down.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"I was nervous about this working, but it works great with our flat dining bench.  The seat of the booster is a little smaller than the depth of the bench, and our 20 month old sits on it nicely.  She leans back and rests on the back with no tipping.  The foam kind of suctions to the wood without really adhering, if that makes any sense.  We love it.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,My kids love this booster! It's very comfy. I would definitely recommend to others. Great products for kids. Easy to clean.Love it! Cute color. Perfect for the kids. Very portable. Great product. Very safe stays put on the chair doesn't slide off. Love it love it love it!,5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"We like that our son can just jump in and out of it and not worry about straps - because he's too big for that now, but I do wish it anchored to the chair in some way to make it a little safer while he's climbing in and out of it.  Otherwise - it's great!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Our two year old is too big for the Booster w/tray style Graco seat that we've been using since graduating from a highchair and just a bit too small for the chair on it's own. This booster is exactly what we needed to bridge that gap. It makes eating a lot more comfortable, a whole lot tidier and most of all safer.The seat raises her up adequately, is soft but firm and has sufficient grip so as not to slide around on the chair. Other reviews have rated the seat negatively for the inability to be stacked on objects such as books to make them taller. If this is a concern to you, do not purchase this seat. Purchase a seat that is made for smaller children, or with adjustable height as stacking any items under a booster seat is not much of an idea for those concerned with the safety of their children.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Exactly as the description says as well as the other reviews. Extremely happy with my purchase and will order another for my next child. The green color is good since I know other products had problems with their colors and it is exactly like the picture. Soft, light and my daughter uses it as a play seat and fits perfectly at the table. Nice and small with just the right height.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,I purchased green one last time for my 3 years old daughter.She loves it much and she said it is very comfortable.I ordered yellow for my friend' baby and will order more for others as a Christmas gift.,5,1

"Stork Craft Beatrice Armoire Chest, Cherry","AFTER READING ALL THE HORROR STORIES, WE WERE LEARY TO PURCHASE BUT DECIDED TO WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR CHILD'S BIRTH.  WE RECIEVED THE ARMOIRE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING THE ORDER. IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER (LESS THAN 1.5HRS). THERE WERE SOME SCREWS MISSING FOR THE DOORS, BUT I CALLED STORCRAFT THE NEXT DAY, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT THROUGH WITH NO BUSY SIGNALS.  THEY SENT OUT THE SCREWS AND I HAD THEM WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS (THEY COME FROM CANADA).  IT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH NOT ONE NICK OR DING IN IT. WE'D RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AS PART OF THEIR CHILDS NURSERY.  FYI - IT WAS NOT CHEAPER AT WALMART ONCE TAX AND SHIPPING WERE INCLUDED.",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Armoire Chest, Cherry","My husband and I are very happy with this armoire!  We have a small apartment with little storage space and this armoir is the perfect size providing loads of extra storage.  I read other reviews so I knew it didn't have a hanging bar, but I knew I wasn't going to be hanging clothes.  One thing I didn't expect was that it was white inside, but it makes it easier to see.  We had it put together within an hour, instructions were easy to follow.  A solid piece of furniture well worth $240.Jessica,NY",5,1
36 x 20 Bedrail,"This installed very easily and is very secure, even when my son rolls into it or climbs up it, it doesn't come loose.  It is also a good height and length, centered along the side of his twin bed, it stops him from accidently rolling off at night, but allows about a foot space on either side where he can easily climb down from the bed once awake.",5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White","Received the chest in 12 days, just as promised. We took everything apart and checked each piece to note any damage. Out of all the pieces there is one minor scratch that will not be noticed unless you take a magnifying glass to the piece. Overall very pleased with the quality. There is alot of solid wood along with the manufactured stuff. Not much diffrent than the same dressers you will find at Babies R Us. Unless you go to the very high end solid wood furniture that would cost well over 3 times this price it is a very good value. Checked all the nuts and bolts. Everything is there. If you want a decent looking nursery piece that will function for you after baby is older you would be hard pressed to find something less expensive with better quality. We received the matching hutch which was in good condition also. As far as the size of the changing pad, Target has one that is 30"" long. It seems to fit this chest.",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White",I bought this piece hoping it would work with the crib that we bought that didn't have a dresser with it.  I was so happy to see that the finishes were perfect together and it looks beautiful.  I was nervous from reading some of the reviews that it would come damaged and not in good shape.  When my husband and I opened the box everything was there and nothing was damaged.  It took us about and hour and half to put it together and was very easy to following the directions.  I LOVE IT and would recommend this item to everyone.,5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White",Product was delievered in perfect condition with all pieces.  The only issue we had was the door on the tower didn't seem to align well at first but now it opens and closes easily after using it several times. It looks beautiful. Great price!

"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","I never write these reviews, but I had to comment after so many negative reviews. First of all, it is CHEAPER at walmart.com with the shipping and taxes included it came up to a total of $254.66. I have both the dresser and the changing table and they are both beautiful pieces at affordable prices. No, everything is not solid wood, but don't waste your money on solid wood when you know you will want to buy your child the latest and greatest bedroom set in the future that matches his or her personality.",5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","The dresser is very nice and sturdy. My husband built in about an hour. The only complaint I have is that the dresser doesn't match the crib or the changing table. Although the box was marked natural an we had to have another sent out because the top drawer was missing, its more of a maple finish. The crib and the changing table were ordered at the same time and from the same store so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. But I am happy with it. Looks great in my little boy 's nursery.",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","I bought this dresser for my baby girl.  I haven't been able to use it continuously yet, since she's not due to be born for another month.  At 8 1/2 months pregnant, I was able to start putting it together myself...but towards the end, thank goodness for my roommate and her friend, I got tired and they finished the rest with little to no problems.  All in all, it took about 2 1/2-3 hours to put it together.I bought the Delta Shelby crib (in the color expresso) from Amazon.com and unfortunately, the same company doesn't make a matching dresser, so I went to Amazon.com and started reading reviews about dressers close to the same color as my crib. Fortunately, I found a review from someone who recommended this dresser as a close match to the Shelby crib.  I was a little nervous, but it actually did match closer than I thought it would.  The crib is a little shinier than the dresser though.I didn't give it the full 5 stars for 2 reasons: 1) The directions were a tad bit hard to understand; especially since none of the dresser pieces have stickers or easily identifiable markings, and the instructions are in black and white (color would be so much easier to understand when they explain the different parts and where they go).  2) It scratches easier than I thought it would, being that type of grain.All in all, it's a beautiful piece of furniture, and very sturdy.  I look forward to using it for years to come!",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","A beautiful piece of furniture - we enjoy the look. It was extraoridinarily easy to put together. All of the pieces were there and fit properly. My husband didn't complain a bit! The only complaint I have was the depth of the drawers - too shallow. The drawer size is mis-leading, so don't plan on a lot of storage. Other than that - nice chest of drawers.",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White","This is a good quality ""assemble it yourself"" dresser.  The fit and finish are very good overall and when completed, the appearance is on par with decent quality pre-assembled furniture.  The drawers slide easily on metal double roller gliders - although the thin fiberboard bottoms feel a bit flimsy.The box this comes in is heavy! and ours looked like it had received some rough treatment during shipping but the packing seemed to be effective at protecting the contents and nothing was damaged.Assembly is a bit time consuming but not difficult.  The only obstacle there was faulty directions.  I have assembled a TON of DIY furniture since I first started buying Ikea stuff back in college and I have a pretty low bar for these multi-lingual, ESL directions - but these were flat out wrong.  The pictures showed a parts configuration that was different from the parts actually shipped.  This caused temporary panic while looking for a ""missing"" part which was shown in the directions but  was not actually part of the piece.  After 20 mins of head scratching, I finally realized the part was not part of this assembly and figured out how to finish assembling the dresser with the included parts some of which were not shown at all in the directions.If Storkcraft can get the directions corrected this would be a 5 star piece at this price.",4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White",This chest was hard to put together but looked nice when it was all said and done!!!  The directions are not that easy to follow. Have patience with this one!!,4,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White","Great product for the money. Was very sturdy and solid. Easy to assemble (I did it without my husbands help!) only complaint would be that you can't fit much in the 3rd drawer because of a cross brace support. Other than that, it's great! I would buy it again!",4,1
Comfort U Pillow -For Total Body Support,"I had a bi-level lumbar fusion at the beginning of January 2014 (happy new year!) and I ordered this from my hospital room more or less on a whim.  I knew I was going to have issues with getting comfortable in bed plus my wife and I compete for the other body pillow we have, so I ordered this and a navy blue cover.  I could not be more pleased.  The pillow can be shaped however you want it, which was ultimately exactly what I needed it to do.  I had to sleep flat on my back for a few weeks so I would get nestled into this beast and pull the ends together under my legs.  Perfectly comfortable.  Now that I am somewhat recovered, it still manipulate it all around to get support exactly where I need it.Awesome pillow!",5,1
Comfort U Pillow -For Total Body Support,Out of all the products I bought for my pregnancy this was by far the best. I slept comfortably throughout my 9 mos. and still use it today. The only downfall is that your bedfellow might feel neglected.,5,1
Graco Seatbelt Locking Clip,"We were desperate to buy this clip for our son's carseat because it didn't come with the second base that we purchased ... and couldn't find it anywhere in stores! I should've known to check amazon first, they have everything! It was very in-expensive and I am so thankful I found it. One of our vehicles is an older model, and this clip was a requirement to tighten the carseat base. It works great - gets the job done and I can drive easier knowing my son is properly locked in and secure. Thank goodness amazon sells this for a good price!",5,1
Child to Cherish ''A Block To Grow On'' in Pink,We love this bank. I have one for my older child and had to order one for my newborn. A great keepsake thats usable and to keep track of their weights and heights. Super cute too!,5,1
Child to Cherish Baby To Bride Bracelet,I love to give this item as a baby shower gift.  I replace the penny with one that represents the year the child will be born.  It is always a big hit.,5,1
Malawi Chair,"I bought this chair for my grandson's first birthday and he loves it.  The safari print is cute and the chair is well-made, and just right for a little toddler to watch his favorite show.  I originally had picked out a small rocker, but found I was reluctant to spend so much on something I wasn't sure he'd like or would even be able to sit in.  This chair is adorable and half the cost of the upholstered rockers.",5,1
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore.  I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time.  Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter.,5,1
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"This floppy is a godsend.  I love how it can hold toys and protects my toddler son's mouth from so many nasty store germies.  The material is soft and comfy so baby isn't sitting on a cold hard seat and it's easy to pack back up into the bag.My only gripe is the price.  Money is no object for my son's safety but $40 can be a lot of money, especially for a full time student.I would recommend this for any parent and I'm very satisfied with this floppy.",4,1
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"We have used this seat for our son since he was about 10 months old, in shopping carts and at restaurants. It is easy to install and fold up-it has pockets in the sides so he can keep his toys with him and keeps his hands clear from all the germs from carts and high chairs. Plus, he looks so much more comfortable in this seat cover! A must for new Moms concerned about germs and keeping baby healthy!",5,1
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"The first time I saw this item, I laughed and thought what a waste of money.  Then, my mom tried to talk me out of it saying it was too much money.  So I went to Babies R Us and tried all of what they had to offer with my son and this is the only one he liked.  I also love this cover.  It works great, I can do it one handed and it has it's own carry case. No more eating yucky germy carts!  I don't know how many times I have been out and people have come up to me asking where I got this item. Two thumbs up from us!!",5,1
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"I love this product! I had originally bought another cart cover that was less expensive, had toys and seemed good enough. But no way, it didn't fit most carts and didn't cover the sides. My son would search for the metal to chew on. YUCK! So I spent the money on this one and don't regret a dime. It even covers the push bar of the cart so my hands can stay clean. With just a bit of practice, its easy to put on and take off. While the padding is nice, it can be bulky to store.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",My wife loves it. Definitely worth the money,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This pillow has been a life savor. I am typically a back sleeper so it was not easy for me to get used to sleeping primarily on my side. I can sleep through the night and stay comfortable on my side with this pillow. Worth every penny in my book.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I've had this pillow since my fourth month of pregnancy. This pillow is the only thing that I've found that allows me to sleep without pain shooting down my leg due to the pinched nerve that I've developed during pregnancy. In fact, the nerve seems to be healing itself and no longer causes pain when I bend over. This pillow works really well to turn a confirmed stomach sleeper into a side sleeper, because you put your head on the curved portion, one of the long sides between your knees, and then the other long side tight behind you to hold you on your side. Before this pillow, I was getting backaches from the strain of using muscles that I'd never used before to hold myself on my side, and I'd always roll back onto my stomach as soon as I went to sleep.There are some downsides to the pillow--firstly, it is huge. My husband jokes that it is my two new boyfriends. Unless you have a  queen sized or larger bed, this will not fit in the bed with you and your husband and you may end up sleeping by yourself in the guest room. Secondly, it is a little tricky to get the cover on and off, although this really is no big deal. Lastly, it does tend to hold you in one position all night, so if you toss and turn a lot, it may frustrate you a bit.Despite those downsides, which caused me to give this pillow a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating, this is the only thing I have found that allows me to get comfortable, relax, and sleep without pain.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","Oh my goodness! I've tried all kinds of maternity pillows, with varying success. But this pillow... wow. This is my 5th baby, and I have tailbone issues, usually I find that these pillows are too squishy and soft. Not this one. It fit me (I am 5'11""), and it gave great support for my back, hips and expanding stomach. I can not say enough good things about it. Instead of dread when I am going to bed, now I am looking forward to nap time and sleep time.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I love it, but my husband hates how much room it takes up in the bed- so only 4 stars!",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","My daughter is now 6 weeks old, and I bought this pillow early on in my pregnancy.  I didn't like the Snoogle, which seemed like it didn't support your whole body.  This pillow did the trick though, and I could sleep without any backpain or even lay it on the floor to watch TV.  My only complaints are that it's HUGE and will most likely push your partner out of the bed.  Also, it's absolutely useless for breastfeeding.  It advertises that you can use it similar to a Boppy, but it's too difficult to manuever, and by that time your child is screaming for food.  If it actually did work as a breastfeeding pillow, it would get 5 stars.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",Awesome product. my wife is 7 months preggo and she love this thing.a must have for preganacy!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I am 6 monthes pregnant and I was just starting to have alot of trouble sleeping.  I bought this pillow and I love it!  I sleep straight through the night now with out tossing and turning trying to get comfortable.  I have alot less trouble with back pain throughout the day since using this product.  Unlike some of the other pregnancy body pillows I've seen, this one supports both the total back and belly at the same time. It feels so cozy.  It also helps keep me on my side because with out it I tend to end up on my back every night.  My husband says I look so comfortable sleeping with this pillow that he wants to use the pillow to sleep after I have the baby. He'll have to fight me for it! Sometimes I even use it to sit or lay comfortably on the couch or floor.  You can use it in so many ways.  Definetely worth the money!  At first I was afraid when ordering the pillow that it would take up too much space in our queen size bed and bother my husband but I was so glad to find out it really doesn't.  Great product.  I would recommend every pregnant woman who has back pain and trouble sleeping to buy this pillow.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I have to say right of the bat, this is the comfiest pillow ever! It is nice and firm and stays put. It has really helped with side sleeping which is insanely painful for me. Actually its so comfy 3 year old son (who fits exactly inside the pillow) keep trying to steal it from me. As does my husband! Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this pillow!!! I am actually able to sleep almost entirely free of pain because of this! And even with me cuddled up with this, it still only takes up half the queen size bed. My husband complains about how little space he has, but he does that even when it's not on the bed so I ignore him. The only thing I hate about this thing (yes hate!) is that the pillowcase is a complete pain in the butt to put back on once you have washed it! If they made it with a zipper instead of a regular style case this would be perfect. Oh,the seam along the curve of the U is kinda painful on your neck and shoulders when you use it next to your head instead of at you feet but bunching a sheet or regular pillowcase along it completely solves that problem.  For me as I have at least a dozen pillowcases this is no big deal. But it might be for others.  It's still so amazing that even these flaws don't deserve to knock down the rating. I am so glad I bit the bullet on this and got it. We almost didn't due to it being $40 for a pillow but it is way worth the cost even if your on a tight budget. As an extra note, I was previously sleeping on my side bundled up in about 6-8 crappy Walmart pillows that went everywhere, never held their shape and that are NOT much help. My main problems were due to pain in my knees, hips, and shoulders and now it's almost 100% pain free! Normally I sleep on either my stomach or my back, so this is also invaluable at keeping me on my side.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","Love this pillow! It made sleeping so much easier for me while pregnant. It gives you support where you need it and you can move it around however you like to add comfort. It also keeps wild sleepers in one position. This is the main reason I bought it so I would make sure I was not sleeping on my back, which is a huge no no while pregnant. I love it so much I don't think I will put it away after I give birth. It's awesome. Definitely a necessary item to have when your pregnant!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I am 7 mos pregnant and this was the best purchase I have made so far this pregnancy.  It supports my tummy and back at the same time helps me get good sleep that has evaded me for a while.  First drawback is the head pillow part w/c is not that supportive so I use another pillow on top of it to lay my head while I sleep.  Second point is the size.  It is big.  We have a Cal King and you can see how this pillow could gobble a sizeable portion of the bed.  Otherwise every one in the family loves to use it so most of the time it is unavailable.  My daughter wants a small one for herself.,4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I am a pillow person and I love this pillow.  Yes, it does have a seem that can be tight across the neck and it gets pretty warm but it cannot be beat for comfort.  As far as the seam goes, I just have to move the pillow up an inch and it no longer bothers me.I am already a side sleeper and toss and turn a lot so that is what I like best about this pillow.  Also I did not realize initially that it has a washable cover but it does so that was a bonus!I recommended this to a friend and she is enjoying hers too!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This pillow has given me the best sleep I've had in four months!!!  It is like a full-body snuggle, whether I'm sleeping on my back, side or tummy.  That's right -- at 31 weeks, I can nap on my tummy with this pillow!  It takes the place of all four pillows that I was using to sleep only half-comfortably.  It can actually support both your back and your belly and knees as you sleep!As the other reviewers said, the major drawback is the built-in distance from my husband.  However, my husband has also napped on this pillow, and will probably fight me for it after the baby comes.I've had some trouble supporting my neck, because I was used to chiropractic pillows and dog-bones.  There is so much to love about this pillow, though.  I'm sure I'll continue to find better positions as I get used to it.If you need sleep, and you're willing to wait until the baby arrives to see your husband again, this pillow is worth the price!!!!!",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I waited until I was 7.5 months pregnant to purchase this and I wish I bought it sooner.  It supports my back and my belly at the same time and allows me restful nights.  It is quite large and takes up a lot of room, but it is worth it.  There are many options on how to use it and it is a great investment.  I am not sure how it will be as a nursing pillow, but we will see.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this when pregnancy forced me to start sleeping on my side.  I've never been a side sleeper and initially tried wedging normal pillows around me.  That didn't work so I eventually sought out this fabulous item.  It has literally made the difference between me being well rested or exhausted and uncomfortable all night long.  I was initially concerned because of the seam issue raised in a previous review.  However, when the pillow arrived, I found that although the seam might be uncomfortable, the issue was 100% resolved simply by placing a pillow on top of this one in the area where your head will go - thus covering the seam and eliminating any potential discomfort.  The pillow is large - if you have anything smaller than a queen sized bed you or your partner might need a new place to snooze, however, the size is what makes it comfortable.  At night I can roll over without having to relocate anything but myself.  Since it wraps around, it mostly prevents accidentally sleeping on my stomach or back which could be harmful to baby and it's substantive without being too big to be cuddly as the person inside it.  This pillow is amazing and I'd highly recommend it if sleeping on your side doesn't come naturally to you.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This is an amazing pillow! Although my husband has to look over my pillow to even see me, I have been sleeping so much better since I received this pillow. If you have hip pain and you hate dragging a pillow from one side to the other when you turn over to the other side at night, then this is the pillow for you! Sleeping on the closed end of this pillow is just okay, but I prefer my own pillow and sleep with the open end at my head. For those who complain about the seam at the neck, just sleep with it the other way like I do. This has proven to be even more comfortable and it does not bother me to rotate the other leg under the pillow when I turn over in the middle of the night, it becomes second nature and I hardly notice it. While I do have to pull the other side close to me every once in a while, having to do so does not keep me from liking this pillow. I move so much at night that I'm not even sure if I have to pull the pillow closer because I moved or the pillow moved. This is a very big pillow (my son refers to it as &#34;mommy's boat&#34;) but it has been worth it for every good night of sleep I have gained with this pillow.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",My wife loves it! The shape allows it to have multiple uses and folds to support your body depending on your need.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I was nervous about buying such a big pillow, but after several months of poor sleep I had to try something.  The first night I used this pillow I did not get up even once!!  I cannot believe the difference it makes in how well I sleep.  And even though it's rather large, my husband sleeps better because I am not tossing and turning every 5 seconds!  This pillow is so cozy and comfortable I wish I'd bought it sooner.  It is a little cumbersome to get into and out of until you get the hang of it, so I would suggest to make sure you have everything you need before you crawl into bed.  You won't regret buying this pillow, but you might regret how long you waited to buy it!!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",Got me through the second half of pregnancy with more sleep than I would have had without it! Definitely a must for pregnant mamas!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I bought this for my daughter who had been having back pain so she was having trouble sleeping.  This pillow allows her to get comfortable and get the sleep she needs.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",Extremely comfortable and reliable.  Lasts forever and makes sleeping so much easier while pregnant. It definitely helps me sleep on my side being pregnant since I use to be a big time belly sleeper.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This pillow has been one of the best pregnancy buys so far.  I have always been a stomach sleeper but we all know that is not good when you are pregnant.  The pillow actually helps me get comfortable on my sides without rolling on my stomach in the middle of the night.  Another good feature is it is an all over body pillow so you don't have to adjust it under the covers at night and wake up your partner.  It is kind of bulky but I have a queen size bed and my husband still has pleanty of roomon his side.  I would definatley recommend this pillow to all pregnant moms!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This pillow is so comfy and I am sleeping much better. It is nice to have two sides to the pillow so I don't have to readjust to turn over. My husband and dog are jealous of how comfy it is!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I love this pillow!!! This pillow is great to have because at night I can just turn side to side without having to readjust and worry about all the pillows falling off the bed.  It is big but I can still make it in and out of bed without problems.  I am also almost 5'10 and I have no complaints about it being too short.  I still use a pillow under my head and one under my feet.  My hips were hurting horribly before I bought it and since the pillow they hurt just every once in awhile and usually if I adjust the pillow the problem is solved.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I got this pillow about a month ago and I absolutely love it.  I was concerned about rolling onto my back and belly while sleeping, so I wanted to get a 2-sided pillow instead of the normal C-shaped pillows.  It is so comfortable.  I use the top instead of a regular pillow.  It's easy to turn from side to side and continue sleeping. It takes up about 1/2 of our queen size bed, but my husband doesn't mind. He will actually use the side closest to him as a body pillow too!  Don't worry about the top seam cutting into your shoulder. I can see how that can happen, but you just need to scoot down to avoid that.I would definitely recommend this pillow. It's like sleeping in your own litle cacoon.  I'm not sure how I'll be able to give it up after giving birth!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I was starting to get very uncomfortable at night when I decided to purchase this pillow...and I REALLY need (and love) my sleep!  Although I still cramp at night sometimes as my pregnancy progresses, my sleep is much more sound with this pillow.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This is so comfortable and helped greatly when I was pregnant.  It's so comfortable, that if it didn't take up so much room in the bed, I would sleep with it all the time!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This was just what I needed. If you sleep with it without a pillow for your head, it can be a little hard on the ears. Otherwise, an amazing sleeping solution for a pregnant woman... or anyone really. My husband takes naps with it.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I was hesitant to spend so much on a pillow but this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It is so comfy it's unbelievable.  I started using it when I was four months pregnant and I began to have some back pain and needed support.  Now it is two months later and I can not bear the thought of sleeping without this pillow!  It's true that it is difficult to get in and out of but an easy fix as suggested by another reviewer is to lift the side up and get out rather than trying to climb out over it.  Unlike some other reviewers, the size seems to fit perfectly for me, I am 5'4"".  I highly recommend it.  Money well spent.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","Good things:-Good investment, gives you a comfortable position so you can have a good sleep during pregnancy-It allows you to turn sides while sleeping without moving the pillow (it can be very uncomfortable if you have to remove your blanket and everything else in order to move the pillow from one side to the other)-Very soft materials-Good support for you backThink twice about getting it:-if you sleep in a very hot place, it is like having a blanket all around you-if you sleep in a small bed, it takes a lot of space!!",5,1

She has found it to decrease back pain and increase comfort while sleeping.  I myself have had back problems on again and off again, and though I haven't slept with the pillow I have tried it out and can easily see that it would be quite relieving when my back does eventually flare up!  My only caution is to be aware that it is BIG.  We have only a queen size bed and I find myself very very .... crowded.  Otherwise, worth every penny!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this product for my daughter.  She had been having excrutiating back pain, and insomnia.

"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this pillow when i was about 2 1/2 months pregnant.  I could never sleep for some reason.  I got the pillow and fell in love with it.  I'm now 27 weeks pregnant and couldn't live without it.  As far as the review where the seam digs into the neck and shoulders, occasionally if i push myself too far up into the pillow this happens... so i readjust and i'm fine.  I love that it goes around both sides of the pillow.  I'm notorious for waking up in the middle of the night on my back (in tremendous pain), so i tuck the side of the pillow on my back under my back snugly and so if i happen to roll over at night it won't allow me to be flat on my back I'm at an angle (which is better for baby and me).  I think the only downfall for the pillow was the cover.  When i ordered mine there was not a replacement cover, so i take it off and wash it.  The cover now has those little beaded balls on it which aren't the most comfortable.  I bought 3 1/2 yards of fabric and made myself a new cover and whalah everything is good.  I do like the idea the person had of cutting the end out of an existing pillow case and sliding it to the middle, I'll have to do that.  Great Purchase, i highly recommend this pillow.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","It is a large pillow so you really need to have a King size bed, but it is amazing!  I most loved the fact that you didn't have to adjust the pillow during the night if you wanted to change positions.  You move, not the pillow.  This pillow helped by hurting back the first night I used it.  I have not had back pain since.  I am currently 21 weeks pregnant.  Definitely would recommend to pregnant women or anyone with back pain!",5,1

"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought the boppy full body pillow first, but it did nothing for me. The Leachco is amazing. It's firm enough that it offers support and i've slept so well since i got it. I use the closed end for my head and use a small pillow towards the end for ankle support.That's not to say it doesn't have it's issues. When you toss, you have to rearrange yourself around the pillow (but this is a minor issue compared with non u-shaped pillows where you have to re-arrange the whole pillow when you turn). It's huge. So on our queen bed, I take up waaayyy too much space.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",She was four months pregnant when I got it for her and she hasn't slept without it for the last month...I've been replaced!!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I never got around to buying a pregnancy pillow with my first pregnancy but since I'm already having a hard time getting comfortable in bed this time, I figured I'd go with the big guns.  So I have nothing to compare to and while it's not perfect, it sure beats using multiple pillows and having to rearrange all of them every time I roll from one side to the other.  I don't at all find the seam to be a problem, something a lot of other reviews point out.  I do, however, find having to keep your bottom arm under the pillow a bit awkward at times.  I'm not sure what the perfect design would be and may try this with the opening at top, using a regular pillow for my head so I have more freedom for my arms (with space between the pillow I use for my head and the one I use for my belly, etc.), but that is my only piece of negative feedback so far.  I love having both belly and back support - this keeps me from rolling onto my back and I think I've woken up less since it's so much easier to roll from one side to the other, again, without having to rearrange a bunch of pillows. Also, I have a queen bed and this takes up just about half, so my husband has plenty of room.  It would work better with a king and I definitely wouldn't get it if you have a full/double, but a queen is definitely doable.  If you want belly and back support in one, this seems like just about the best all-in-one option out there.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",LOOOOOOVVVEEEEEE this!!!!! I used this from my first trimester into the first few months my son was born. These are super expensive in stores but this was a great deal. My friend liked mine so much she bought one too.  Thanks!,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I am used to sleeping on my stomach but by my 4th month it wasnt too comfortable, so i orderd the pillow. Great support. I definatly sleep a lot better now. Its Great!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this pillow while I was pregnant with my first child, and I'm now on my third pregnancy. Around month 7 and on, it is a lifesaver and the only way I can get sleep. The pillow provides support on your back, stomach and knees all at the same time, and it's nice because you don't have to change the pillows around during the middle of the night - you can just switch sides. It also helps if you also use a thin pillow at the curve for extra support on your neck. I highly recommend this pillow to all pregnant ladies!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I brought this pillow for my 2 sisters and they both loved the pillows. They even sleep on them still even after their pregnancies..,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","Love this item,,pregnant or not! Perfect for back support or just to snuggle with. Very Comfortable. Need to purchase a cover",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I recommend this pillow to anyone who is pregnant. Its great to sleep on during those difficult toss and turn nights. Pregnancy is not easy especially as your belly gets bigger and bigger but without this pillow I dont know how I could have slept without it. Also I had two C sections and it helped a great deal during the recovery periods. It keeps you in angled position and makes it much easier to get up without hurting a lot.,5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I use this pillow because I have a herniated back disk that needs surgery to repair.  It's very hard for me to sleep on my back (or any way, actually) and some one had told me about these pillows, and I went and bought one to try.  IT WORKED! I am able to sleep in just about every position very comfortably.  And this pillow can itself be adjusted to fit specific sleep problems and I have tried them all with much enthusiasm and I can't even begin to pick which way is the most comfortable because, I don't know myself.  They ALL work.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I love this pillow. Before I was just using a regular body pillow and it was difficult to take the pilow with me when I wanted to roll over. This is pillow is awesome b/c you don't have to worry about that. I also love the back support it provides. I got this pillow when I was about 4 month pregnent. I'm currently 35 weeks and still using it. I think the further along you are the more helpful this pillow is. I was having trouble sleeping and it definitly helped!It would be nice if it were a little longer though. It works pretty well for me (I'm 5'6"""") but for someone taller it might be to small- unless you really curl up when you sleep.I've washed the pillow case a couple of times. It's a little difficult to put it back on. I ususally need my husband to help me. It's more time consuming then anything. Over all though I highly reccomend this pillow.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","It feels like you are constantly being hugged and is a life saver for a bad back. Just turn and no adjustment needed. When you first get it, it may seem WAY too puffy. I gave it one less star because it gets flat relatively fast but this is the best price around and for the comfort it gives me, I'll just keep buying them.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I am 22 weeks pregnant and I was recommended to sleep on the sides. My hips were aching like crazy since they were not able to take my body weight. My belly would feel like there are many parts hanging in there when I change positions especially. After much research I decided to order this product. It is a boon I would say. It supports your back and the belly as the name says. I do not put the entire weight on my hips anymore. I slightly tilt on either sides so my belly gets supports from the curved portion of the pillow and back rests comfortably on the other side of this pillow. As many other have reviewed, it does have an uncomfortable seam. I just wrapped a soft towel over it and have a pillow on top of it for that extra height so I do not get heart burns. I have a queen size bed - my husband and I fit in comfortably. This is the first time I have reviewed a product since I felt it is totally worth the money and would be helpful for many others who are going through the same problems.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",My sister loved this product. She said it's so comfortable and soft. She used while she sleeps and sitting down. It's a great purchase. No discoloration and maintains its shape.,5,1
Jardine Dark Pine Glider with Beige Micro Fiber Fabric,"I shopped and shopped and shopped and ended up with this rocker and ottomon. So far so good. The chair was VERY easy to assemble and the ottomon comes assembled. Is very stable and doesn't creak or pop at all. The back cushion was the most comfortable out there as far as plushness and height (I can lay my head back on it and am 5'5""""). Wide seat. Very thick bottom cushion that was softer in the store but I think that is because of so many people sitting on it. You will not feel the wood underneath the cushion!!! Looks great in my living room!!! I sat in the cheaper models and could not sell myself short. Even my 6-year old fell in love with this model. THIS CHAIR IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!",5,1
Evenflo Traditions Booster Seat - Devon Black,"I purchased the ""Greystone Generations Harness Booster Seat"" and returned it within 3 weeks. I loved the fact that my son would have armrests since most carseats seem so uncomfortable because there is nothing there. The right armrest broke off after just a few weeks of minor use. I returned it and purchased the ""Traditions Booster Car Seat"" -- I love the fact that the straps are adjustable from the front (it hurts to have to squeeze your hand through to the back - especially when you don't want to have to unbuckle everything, safety harnesses and whatnot). Too, the armrests are very easily attached but very sturdy and you can take them off whenever you want. It is a great feature. It seems that with the ""Generations"" seat instead of being comfortable, my son seemed more uncomfortable with the arm rests. The ""Traditions"" is a good buy and a wonderful car seat. No kid loves a car seat, but at least this one keeps him comfortable.",4,1
Evenflo Traditions Booster Seat - Devon Black,"I bought this carseat to fit in the back of my 2001 Sentra (which isn't too roomy in the back). It fits wonderfully. I felt that this was a pretty good car seat. However it has its pro's and con's.Pro's: inexpensive, a lot of little extra's including the goodie bag, cup holder, head pillow, and extra lumber padding on top of an already very padded seat, also very nice looking for the price.Con's: Getting the shoulder straps to adjust was EXTREMELY trying...they definately make it seem much easier than it is. Also, the armrests seem pretty cheap considering they ""pop"" into place and are not attached to the seat.Overall I'm happy with the purchase and my daughter loves it!",4,1
Paper Dolls Pillow,First the set is not being taken off the shelves and replacds with Blossoms.  It is NOT on the list of discontinued bedding patterns at BRU.  I got that straight fromteh manager who called corporate to make sure.  They have just brought in more items to coordinate with this line so it's not going anyway.This was one of those final touches that we weren't sure if we wanted to spend the money on but I'm glad we did!  I kept it in the closet until we converted our crib into the toddler bed.  I dug it out of the closet to use as a toss pillow on her daybed nad it really is a nice touch.  It makes her bed look not so plain now and it's teh perfect size for her to play with.  So it was a good purchase and great finishing touch to a wonderful pattern.,5,1
Hohner / 8&quot; Toddler Rainmaker,Great toy for 9 months and up.  Once they can hold it in their hand and twist on their own.  The adults liked it as well!,5,1
Evenflo Whisper Connect Sensa Monitor,"My husband and I originally wanted a video monitor, but decided to go with this monitor since our son's room was only next door.  This monitor is perfect. We hear EVERYTHING, from his breathing to the kids outside playing.  I love this monitor.  I'm giving it 4stars because the alarms goes off on it's own sometimes.  My son is 6 1/2 months and it's gone off only about 3-4 times, but it was very annoying when it did...especially in the middle of the night.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I'm glad we registered for it.",4,1
Graco Swingomatic 6 Speed Swing - Windsor,"My 2 sons used the same Graco 6 speed open top swing (we have a different pattern than the pictured Windsor pattern). I am expecting my 3rd son very soon, so I thought I might try one of these newer model swings i.e Graco Hug swing, Graco Silouette swing, Fisher Price Cradle swing, etc. After careful research and actually looking over them all at Babies R Us and Target, I have come to the conclusion that my ""old"" swing is better. I like that it is higher off the ground, so I don't have to bend over as far to put my baby in it. Like the newer models (that I suppose are advertised to be improved and better), my older swing has the same recline position, legs fold for storage, snack tray, safety belt, some models have an overhead mobile, music option, and speed varieties. I happen to think the older models can be used for longer. The ""Papasan"" and ""Hug"" and ""Siloutte"" are like a round bucket so when your child is bigger they look as if they are way too big to be in it, but the traditional seats make your child look normal to be in it as they grow. I believe the weight limits are ll the same too in the 25-30 lbs range. I also found that the seat covers on the Graco open top are easy to remove and wash (as most Graco products). Can't see spending $130 for a new swing when I am content with my old $80 swing, it has given me it's worth.",5,1
Graco Swingomatic 6 Speed Swing - Windsor,"I have to say that this swing was a lifesaver for my colicky baby. She had the need to be swung rapidly since she was abt 6 weeks old, and now at 5 mos, she can still get it crankin! It is pretty, quite comfy w/ 2 sized head supports, and it reclines well. I found the music to be kind of tinny sounding, but we rarely used it. I also found that in 5 months of CONSTANT use, Ive only had to change the batteries once! I only gave it 4 stars b/c we had some problems w/ the mobile. Every time it swung, the mobile inched backwards until it was behind the swing. Not really useful if baby wants to look at it and it is behind them. I had to tape it so that it doesnt move. Other than that minor complaint, I love it. Ill be saving this one for the next baby!",4,1
Fisher Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"Works great as a swing, however, for newborns, I would definitely suggest a snugli head rest because it comes with no support, once the child can sit up, you can remove it. Also, although it does recline as an infant seat and is more than adequate it does NOT vibrate so we had also a vibrating infant seat. Now my son is 1 and he sits in the rocker all the time and seems to enjoy having ""his chair"" whereas the vibrating infant seat has been in the attic for 4 months awaiting a yard sale.",5,1
Fisher Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"We registered for this, but also recieved a bouncy chair, so never used it as the infant seat.As a swing, my son didn't really like it until almost 7 months. For smaller infants, I think it doesn't recline far enough.  The seat holds a child almost sitting upright.  Our son prefers the higher rocking level, but both are fine. We don't use the music  much, though there's no problem with it. I tend to put him in this to watch his Baby Einstein videos, so the music is unnecessary.My son doesn't use it as a rocker, yet, but my almost 3-year-old niece loves it and spent plenty of time sitting in it last time she visited. It's a nice comfy chair and I look forward to my son using it up to that age at least.It's great that it folds up, we put it away anytime he's not in it, and I've even been able to easily fold it up and take it outside to swing on the porch.I took off one star because it's far too easy to stop the rocking when it's in swing mode.  Walking past it and bumping it, or the dog bumping it, or even the baby's blanket sliding down until it drags on the floor causes the rocking to stop.",4,1
Fisher Price Flutterbye Music Crib Toy,This thing projects on to the ceiling and has been through 2 kids so far! My 2 year old learned to sooth himself with this toy in the middle of the night. He stands up turns it on lays down talks to the birds and falls asleep within the 10 minutes it plays for. My sister wants it now for her babies since she can't find it in the store but I'm not giving it up till mine shows no interest at all.,5,1
Skip Hop Duo - Cord-Camel,"This bag does not look like a diaper bag so I will be able to use it long after the baby gets bigger.  It is not huge (which I like) and holds enough items for a day trip.  It has a side pocket for a bottle and the other pocket I use for pacifiers.  The two zipped pockets on each top side are great for keys, cellphone, wallet, etc because they are not very deep so you are not searching for your items at the bottom of the bag.The outer two pockets are great for toys or bibs.  The inside has some pockets that I use for diapers.  It is large enough to hold a blankie, change of clothes, wipes, diapers & 2-3 bottles.  The strap is adjustable in length and it converts so you can hang it on the stroller handle(s).  It comes with a changing pad.I love the cord material and the color is also my favorite.  If you don't care for the cord material, you can get one made from canvas at Target for $30 in either black, red or camo.  I have the black one and love it as well.  It is called Spark instead of Skip Hop but is made by the same company and both look very similar.",5,1
HABA Rattling Caterpillar Dangling Figure,"I love that this toy is made w/ non-toxic paint. It's very cute and I'm sure will be very durable. The string that holds it all together is elastic...so when you pull on the ring on the bottom, the little pieces click & clack together. The red loop on the top looks like it will be able to stretch and attach to anything (car seat, stroller, etc.)  Nothing fancy - just a simple, cute toy.",4,1
Max Clutching Toy,"This makes a really pleasant, delicate, clacking sound.  It's durable, the wooden stain stays brightly colored and is non-toxic, and you only have to wipe it with a damp cloth to clean it.  It was even cuter in person than in the picture and it made my 3-month-old sons smile and reach forward.  Total winner.",5,1
Max Clutching Toy,"At 14-months, our daughter still plays with this toy. Love the fact it's made of wood and not plastic. We have tons of pictures from last summer when she was an infant with Maxe in her mouth! Great toy for the young ones.",5,1
Haba Circo Pulling animal,"My son loves toys that he can drag behind him and this is his new favorite toy.  Even my older daughter likes to pretend it is a ""dog"" on a leash.  Haba's toys are always well made and very durable, I bought baby toys for my daughter 4 years ago that still look brand new after 2 kids. The little cogs do fall out very easily, but I just keep them out until one of them wants to play with them.  Worth every penny!",5,1
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,"When I was picking toys for my 4 month old daughter, I thought this one looked like a winner.  All of the colors, and the interesting shape, plus those other two rings--doesn't that look fun?Eh.My daughter isn't really impressed.She likes the triangles better.  I thought theTriangle Rattlelooked kind of boring, but it had such high reviews I thought I would give it a shot.  Turns out my daughter is crazy about the triangles.  I think it's partly because this toy is wider around than the triangles are, so it is easier for her to hold the triangles.If the triangles are not available, my daughter will hang onto this for a few minutes.  I suspect she will probably like it more as her hands and mouth get a little bigger.I'm still glad we bought this, but if you're choosing between this and the triangles and you're purchasing for a young child, I'd recommend the triangles.  Even though this looks more fun.",4,1
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,Haba toys are always of high quality and I love that they are made of wood. This one was especially cute.,5,1
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,This is a great toy that doesn't seem to get old.  My little one has had it since he was about 5 mths old.  As he has gotten older he is enjoying it more.  Great to chew on and rattle around.  Bright colors and simple.  Not plastic and is safe!! Highly recommend.,5,1
HABA Allezhoop,"We just got this for my 8-month old, and she is in love.  This offers so many textures of interest to the mouth, and curious little fingers are busy moving each of the parts and then pausing to give the whole thing a big bang on the table.  Definitely a hit with her, and I'm thrilled that it's wood with non-toxic paints!",5,1
HABA Discovery Block Set,"These blocks are great -- well constructed and safe, like all HABA toys, but also brightly-colored and fun.  Our baby (now 8 months) has been enjoying these blocks for months, and she clearly prefers them to her other set, which seem so much more drab in comparison.  The yellow block with green bell is her current favorite and she loves make it jingle.  These blocks were my introduction to HABA toys and I am now a convert.",5,1
Haba Salto Rattle,"When I first received this toy, I was a little disappointed at how small it was, but it is the perfect size for tiny little hands. When we first gave it to her, she would just grab onto it and wave it around, then as she got older, she would hold it with one hand and focus on turning the rainbow beads in the center. She also uses it as a wooden teething ring, and still enjoys banging it around, tambourine-style. Well-made, solid toy that will certainly still be around for a younger sibling.",5,1
Haba Salto Rattle,I own about 6 types of Haba toys.  I have a 6 month old and this is his favorite.  It's easy to grab and he doesn't drop it fifty-million times like other toys.  Haba is such a wonderful marker of wooden toys.  I recommend this toy whole-heartedly.,5,1
Elephant Grasping Toy DC,"This little toy is adorable. I didn't look at the size of it when I was purchasing it though and I should have. It says it is approx. 6"" long, which it is, but bare in mind that a good 3"" of that is nose! Still, it's not called a ""grasping toy "" for nothing. It is small enough for my newborn to hold it and I like that about it.Just be prepared though, it is small for the $13.00 (after you also pay for S&H;) you pay for it. It apprears to be of good quality, and well it should be for that price! I think if I had known it was going to be this tiny though I would not gotten it due to it just being too expensive for what you are getting. The pic they have of it makes it look a lot bigger than it actually is. But I am going to keep it and just be more careful in the future and look at the size of items before buying them. However, if you've got the money to blow on really cute but really small toys, I say go for it because it really is very sweet.",4,1
Single Animal Jingle Bell (Assorted Styles),"However, it might be a choking hazard for younger kids. This animal bell ended up in a drawer for a while after Christmas because she liked to put the bells in her mouth. For bigger kids it's lots of fun, and it is now looper around her babydoll stroller. Overall good purchase!",4,1
North States Supergate Wire Mesh Gate,"Was received very quickly, I liked that alot. The gates are what they say they are. I was very pleased.",4,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,"I bought this two years ago, and keeps in one piece. It's really useful on wide doors or large space between walls, keeps my dogs in one place on the house when we need it.",5,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,"This gate is perfect! I have a wider hallway and none of the other pet/kids gates would work. Once I figured out the &#34;just right&#34; measurement on the grooves, I marked it with a sharpie so it would be easy to put into place every time.My dog doesn't push, lean or try anything with the gates, but this does keep good tension when up.I would suggest this pet gate.",5,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,Ordered the child gate as a replacement for the same item purchased locally at a much higher price. It was exactly the same and arrived earlier than promised. No problems and very satifified.,5,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,"The gate works great and is very easy to set up single handed. Creates a very secure barrier for our dog. One minor design flaw means that if you locate the gate inside the lip of moulding in your door jam, the locking arm mechanisms can mar the wood moulding. There's no need to set up inside the moulding as the locking is very secure wherever you set it up, but a minor change in the design could eliminate the problem.",4,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,I use this gate to block a large hallway and keep my dogs in a structured area.  It's wide and tall - just the right dimensions for a Golden Retriever.  The dogs don't challenge the gate.  If they did it probably wouldn't hold up that well.  Price and shipping were typical Amazon - great!,4,1
North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate,great price for this sturdy gate that is easy to set up and leaves no damage to walls. Highly recommend this gate.,5,1
North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate,"Our new house has an odd feature where the back is fenced in, but the dogs can run up the steps and out to freedom due to the lack of a gate.  This gate basically seals in our steps so that the dogs can run around without us worrying about where they might be in ten minutes.For me, that means 5 stars as it was cheap, quick to install, and completely what I needed.  However, less than 2ft high might be problematic for containing some kids/animals.  Also, as noted by others, I wouldn't want to have to adjust this gate often, though maybe only being 23inches tall could solve the need to take it down!",5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,We bought this for our dog because he had knee surgery and we were trying to restrict him from going up the stairs. This product is wide and high enough to cover an open area that we needed to cover. It's adjustable and it worked fantastically!,5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,i have two small dogs that i was trying to keep out of my living room until i got home in case one of them had an accident. This is hte perfect width and height for both of them.,5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,"We have 3 cats,and they have claws.It works great to kept them away from our banana leaf dining chairs !!",4,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,"I've had this gate for almost two years since my daughter started crawling and we needed a wide gate for an entryway.  This gate has been very reliable, durable, and importantly safe for my child.",4,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,I am so glad I didn't pay a lot of attention to the negative feedback of this product.  It is everything and more.  I have 2 dogs and 5 cats.  The cats use this as a spring board and the dogs jump on it and yet it holds up perfectly.  I am tempted to get another one for the front of the house.  This product is much better priced than the others.  Extremely happy.  Thank you,5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,Works great.  Wide enough and easy to use.,5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,This gate closes off a 72 inch opening at the top of six deck stairs.  It was super easy to install & is of high quality.  It can be opened from either side & is sturdy...definitely 5 stars!,5,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,"I wanted a tall, sturdy gate to go across the top of our front porch steps so my two border-aussie dogs could be on the porch without being hooked up to leashes. The gate was easy and quick to install and I like that it opens from either side and is also easily removed from the hinges when I don't need the gate there.",5,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,I purchased for my dog and it has worked so well! It didn't take long at all to put up and it is so easy to use. You can open from either side and is easily stored away.,5,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,I have a rough and rowdy silky terrier which will just run out my front door and not come back without chasing him so I have two sets of steps on each side of my porch with railings all around. I now can open my front door without Scout getting out. They are easy to assemble and so easy to operate.,5,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,I purchased this gate for a the opening into my kitchen. It is an odd caddy corner shaped opening. The gate was easy to install and works great. We purchased it to keep my 8 month old son from crawling into the kitchen to eat the dog's food! He is almost 2 now and we still use it to keep him out of the kitchen. He has never pinched a finger or any other part of his body. My 5 year old is able to open and shut it with ease. It is very durable and his withstood my son shaking it back an forth. I guess you could say it is kid tested and mother approved.,5,1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,"Ease of expanding and contracting the gate is a little rough, but okay. The clasps that close around eye hooks feel a bit rickety, can be challenging to secure, but once you get the hang of it it's workable.Overall decent. Keeps an Airedale on the deck.",4,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory",This has worked pretty well to keep our dogs out of areas that we don't want them to be if we are not home.  It's sturdyand would work well for children as well.  It can be hard to slide if you don't grab it in the right place.,4,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","Item as described.  Nice sturdy gate. I purchased it for a gift, but was missing a part when it arrived so I had to send it back.",4,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","This is my second North States gate.  First one has worked great until I lost a part during a move.  The company sent me a replacement part FOR Free! You can't beat that for customer service.  When we needed another gate, it was an easy choice.",5,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","I have two small dogs and a 6 ft opening from the kitchen to the living/dining room/front hall.  I did not want to spend $100 plus on a gate.  It must be improved recently because I did not find any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  My husband had no problems installing it, granted he is an engineer.  It moves smoothly and I have no problem unlatching it with one hand while holding a wiggling puppy in the other.  It does the job and did not cost me much.  If it is not as attractive as a wooden gate, so be it.",4,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","this is the second one we've owned. our other one held up for at least 8 years, as it is at the top of the stairs at my mother's ranch house, with constant grandkids in and out. the only problem we've had after having it awhile, was sometimes the gate would get stuck and you'd have to keep yanking to get it to seperate to close it. the reason for having to purchase a new one, is someone was latching it shut, slipped, and fell down the steps trying to catch the fall by grabbing the gate and taking it with them! other than that incident, it is a very sturdy gate that kids are not able to figure out how to open.",4,1
"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory",I would recommend this fence to anyone with a big opening and or have animals. This has stood up to so much abuse. It still works just as good as the first day I bought it. I bought a second one for another door way cause I love this fence so much. Awesome is all I can say,5,1
Evenflo Embrace Infant Car Seat Base Black,I liked this brand of car seat and base.  The base was easy to install and easily adjusted.  It was durable.  I had no problem with this base during my daughter's first year of life.,5,1
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Brown - 8 Pack,,5,1
KidKusion KidSafe Deck Guard,"I was quite skeptical about the looks but this product looks better at home than I thought just by seeing the picture. The price is great, and the size too. It is easy to cut and trim around the edges to fit where you need. The plastic is sturdy and it does the job keeping the children safe.",5,1
KidKusion KidSafe Deck Guard,This product is as described. It is a clear mesh that is very strong.  It is very easy to install and easy to cut down to size. We installed it on a condo balcony and it fit just right. It only took a few minutes to unroll and tie on to the railings. Worth the price and the peace of mind for our 3 yr old grand daughter.,5,1
Blossoms - Wall Border,"I LOVE this item! It was the perfect touch to our nursery, we painted the bottom a dark pink and the top a shade lighter, with the boarder in the middle, it was perfect. The wallpaper was so easy to hang, it went up without any problems, I would definatlly recomend you buy this for a finishing touch!!",5,1
Magic Moments Learning Seat,"I received this as a gift, and at first my child wasn't crazy about it.  The lights and music were too much for him.  Now that he's 3 months old and can reach the hanging animals, he seems to enjoy it a lot more!  He can sit and interact with it for about 10-15 minutes, then he seems to have had enough.  I love Leap Frog products, and this one is worth the buy.",4,1
Magic Moments Learning Seat,"My 3 1/2 month old grandson LOVES this chair!  Overall great quality, easy to put together.  He gets so excited when I go to put him in it!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother! My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then! I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have. So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase. I love this swaddler!  During a recent shopping trip my husband found it and thought it would be a good idea.  I like to let him pick something out occasionally so I tossed it in the basket.  I really didn't think we'd use it much.  Boy, was I wrong!  We use it every night. What I like most about it is the adjustable sides.  You can make it as tight as you want and the velcrow keeps it in place. Which keeps me from worrying about the blanket moving up and covering the babys face or mouth. This is definitely one of our favorite purchases!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","This item is awesome. My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight. No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out. There's no way of getting out of this one. My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one. The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot. So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating. I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.",4,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","Our little one slept through the night at seven weeks thanks to the SwaddleMe.  We can change her diaper without unwrapping her arms, helping her stay relaxed and sleepy in the evenings.  The SwaddleMe wraps also wash very well.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",This product is like swaddling for dummies! It is great for those who have problems swaddling babies with a traditional blanket. It makes it very easy to calm a screaming baby!,4,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","I love this I just can't wait to use it. it looks very easy to use and is so soft. I will surley be buying another. it has a little slot so you can swadle your baby in their bouner or swing and still be able to buckle them in,I thiught that was really cool and if I recall it is not mentioned in the description.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",We brought our son home from the hospital and he would not sleep in his bassinet.  He would only sleep on my or my husband's chest.  Needless to say we were not sleeping...  I put this on him and in 10 minutes he was asleep and slept 4 hours until his next feeding time.  AMAZING!  Go get this product and never let it go.  A must have...,5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","We bought two of these with our first child at about 6 weeks of age.  I finally was able to get 5 consecutive hours of sleep.  We're using the same two with our 2nd child and I have been able to get much better sleep earlier (knowledge is power).  Other reviewers have complained about their children wriggling out which occassionally happens, but I found that if I put them to sleep in long sleeves, they have a harder time getting out.  Also, I had to use the conventional swaddling method until my 2nd child weighed about 10 pounds--I couldn't wrap the swaddleme tight enough until then.  I have not had a problem with my children pulling the velcro apart, but I'm very careful about aligning the velcro when wrapping the child.  Note:  The fleece is very thin, not thick like a sweatshirt, and it is quite stretchy.  You don't have to worry about your child overheating.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","I had read the reviews on SwaddleMe and was excited to buy one for my granddaughter Allison, who was born Nov of 2008. It was going to be a Christmas present! Christmas eve Allison was fussy so I talked her parents into opening up the SwaddleMe and  they tried it on her that night.  Allison's mom had to wake her up on Christmas day! So it was actually two gifts in one. First, a full night's sleep for her parents and secondly, a secure good night's sleep for Allison! They love this item and even pack it with them to daycare.  As a grandmother, I highly recommend this item as being on the top of the list for all new parents as well as the child. Make life easier and happier for your baby with a SwaddleMe, you'll be glad you did!",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,This soft but impermeable bib is perfect for protecting baby's clothes from the exceses of learning to eat like a human being. It is soft but im-permeable and completely washable. The &#34;well&#34; in front catches spilled liquids of all kinds. A ingenius design.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Rubber, attaches around neck and difficult for baby to pull off.  Has a nice dip in the bottom to catch all the food that misses the mouth!  Easy to wipe off and clean.  I have two grandchildren under the age of 3, one is a boy, the other a girl so these colors of green & pink worked out great.  Would make a great shower gift and I love that I'll be able to use for quite some time.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"I was worried that the stiffness of these bibs would bother my daughter, but she didn't mind them at all. They work great to catch all of the food she drops, and she is able to dig things out to eat them. There is a lot less food wasted and a lot less mess to clean up.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Each of our children has one of these bibs. Unlike our friends who seem to have a drawer of molding, nasty bibs, this is all we use. Our oldest has been using hers for 3 years and it's going strong. The icon is wearing out, but that doesn't affect functionality.Our 20 month old tears his off and likes to throw it down on the ground. He gets time out for that. He also gets his food taken away until he puts the bib back on. So yes, it's not bolted on to the kids, but we feel we can teach them to keep it on.Pros:Indestructible (in our experience)Easy to cleanCatches foodHolds lots of liquidComfortable around the neckCons:Bulky when taking to restaurantsIf full when kid tears it off, lots of food/liquid can get flung far and wide (pay attn, be proactive)These make excellent baby shower gifts and we often get positive comments about them when we're eating out.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Fabric bibs never worked for us. My son would either put them in his mouth getting the bibs even dirtier along with his shirt, or he pulls them off entirely. These bibs do a much better job at keeping him clean and they are easy to clean as well.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Using cloth bibs when my son started solids at five months was frustrating. The bibs stained, required immediate hand washing to minimize stains and still the bibs looked very bad. This bib has solved all the problems. I have been using it for 4 months now and this is the best ever. After each meal you can just wash it with water and at the end of the day throw it in the dishwasher...no stains. Best of all when my son threw up a couple of times the bib contained all the mess beautifully, no mess even on his clothes. Cloth bibs are good only for bottle feeding. This is a must have to make all moms life simpler.Update: My son who is 14 months old is able to easily pull it off as the fastner comes off if he tugs at it. The kiddopotamus bibbity works better now as it has a button type fastner which he cant pull off. Baby bjorn should fix this feature for sure.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"I have tried SOOO many bibs for my twins, on a quest to find one that would minimize mess to the high chair, their clothes, and the floor. I can't begin to tell you how many bibs I own! I recently saw this on Amazon and bought it...they are the BEST! I recommend them to everyone! They're great because they contain the mess...the size is adjustable to your baby's neck size...and they wash SUPER easily.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,My boy has been wearing this since 6 months and it has been the perfect bib.  It's easy to clean and it catches all of his spilled food and drink.  My only complaint is now I have a ton of conventional bibs that I have no use for!,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Yes, I think they're very useful and pretty nice, but my baby cries when I put it around his neck. He prefers to use it like a toy. !!",4,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,it's quite convienent. a lotof people will ask me about it when they see we use it for my kid.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,I thought they looked funny when I saw them at the baby store.  But use them once and there's no going back to an old fashioned bib for baby's mealtimes.  It catches most of the mess and is easy to clean.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"I've been desperately looking for a bib for my very messy 13mo. She hates wearing bibs and loves to rip them off. Based on everyone's review, I ordered the Baby Bjorn bib hoping it would solve our problems. The bib itself is great - it catches food and keeps everything off my daughter when she wears it. However, she's so strong and has learned to pull it right off! I would have easily given the bib 5 stars but since my daughter can rip it off, I've knocked it down to 4. I'm off to trying l/s smock/bibs!",4,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,My sister in law recommended these to me and I'm so annoyed at myself for not ordering them sooner! They fit snugly so food doesn't spill onto clothing; super easy to wash and dry right in the sink; they catch spitup/throwup easily; soft but strong material. Love love these for my 11 month old son who is enjoying food with all of his senses (he's a hot mess when finished!) Highly recommend.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Very good! Quality is very good,The delivery is fast,This is what I like,Everything for the children,Will recommend to my friends to buy",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,They are perfect for the mess that involves feeding an infant / toddler. They are easy to clean and are great looking,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,My daughter and I love these bibs for her  little girl/my granddaughter.  They catch all her spills and are a breeze to wash up by just rinsing under the faucet.  They fit her well time and make lunch time fun and easy to clean up.  We would definitely highly recommend these bibs!,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"These bibs are great!  Easy to wash, no more moldy fabric bibs.  The catch at the bottom is amazing.  I love these so much, I stocked up for gifts.  the only down side is I wish they were a little more flexible so the bib would be more flush against my son.  other than that, great bibs!",4,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,GREAT product!!  So easy to clean.  I love that I don't need to do a wash to get clean bibs I just rinse them off after she's done eating and then I attach them to her high chair to dry.  Love how it catches lots of food too.  It works best for up to age 18 months.  I'm finding it's a bit small for her now....I need more like a smock haha!!,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Like a child.Color and material is good.Water-wiped, the child that spills can be handled cleanlygood, good, good",4,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Nice, I brought this for my niece and nephew. This can prevent food dropped on the floor. and it is easy to clean or wash it. However, it is a bit hard, so my niece feels slightly uncomfortable around her neck. And also because of this materials, it is inconvenient to carry when traveling.",4,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"These are fantastic. Forget cloth bibs you need to wash after every use, the flimsy reusable ones that are hard to clean (like the Bumkins or Kushies), soft plastic ones that rip or bend over so the cup part doesn't catch anything (like OneStep Ahead) - these are excellent. We gave all the others away and just need two of these. And my boy's a mess. But they're so easy - you put them on, the hold their shape so catch almost everything, and are super easy to clean up (just a quick rinse). No mess, no piles of dirty bibs to wash, great. We used them for my daughter too. She wasn't nearly such a messy eater - but neat or messy - these bibs work great. Yes, they are stiff, but that's why they hold their shape. They're not uncomfortable though. Both my boy and girl wore them from 6m to 3years without complaints.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"These bibs are great.  My sister uses them for both my nieces and so I knew I would get it for my little one.  They are easy to put on, take off, clean, and I love how the shape holds and catches food, unlike the other flimsy bibs.  The only thing is that it's not as compact but I still bring it with me when I travel because I just love it.",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,I spent more time cleaning my 8 months old highchair after he would eat. I saw this bib come through and Amazon email and read the reviews and decided to buy ASAP!!! We used it already and yay....for catching all the food that would undoubtedly fall on my LO lap and get stuck between his highchair and clothes...etc. He didn't like me putting it on him... since its a bit stiff and he wants to chew on it... but once we started eating he forgot all about that... It washes so easy too! Hope to buy another one soon!,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"The bib is quite good .At first the baby also use it, but then a little resistance.Don't have to now hold",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,I have been using my for two years every day and it still looks like new. I wash it in dishwasher. Highly recommended.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,This bib is great for older babies and toddlers.  I've gotten sick of washing the cloth ones and they get stained easily.  These wash very easily.  They are flexible plastic so it depends how high your high chair tray is and how tall your child is as to if these fit correctly.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"quite good...my son like it very much. :)easy to clean,easy to wear,good product zan zan zan zan zan zan zan.....",5,1
CitiTour Tandem Stroller - Tattersall,"Unlike several of the other reviewers, I really like this stroller! (We even have the matching infant carrier.) I have a 3yr old (weighs 29 lbs) and a 2 1/2 mo. old (weighs 12.9 lbs) and I use this stroller alot. Granted the wheels started to make a tiny noise but it was after getting the wheels wet and WD40 cleared the problem up fast. It's the MOST compact double stroller out there currently. It's comfortable material and very roomy for both children. The adult cup holder is roomy and sturdy. Plenty of pockets & storage too!I'm shocked to see all these wheels falling off!! Since I put this stroller together it makes me wonder if all these wheels weren't put on correct because it was a little complicated part of the instructions.Also, I put my 3yr old in the front or back and either way it still turns and moves good expecially compared to other double strollers I steered and moved around.  I hunted for 6months for a double stroller and this is by far the best one!",5,1
Dermo-Cleansing 500ml. (16.90 FL OZ),"Us moms want the best for our little ones and that doesn&#8217;t stop at how we keep our baby clean. Mustela Bebe Dermo-Cleansing is a cleansing gel for hair and body that is soap-free and does not sting babies eyes. It softens skin and helps soothe irritation with its formula containing vitamin B5.This is a hypoallergenic cleanser which minimizes the risk of allergic reactions (which is something I love) and compensates for the drying effect of hard water with its super-fatted agents (coconut derivatives). Mmmm coconut!This is a gel texture although the lathering is perfect. It&#8217;s not to thin where it looks like you haven&#8217;t put any soap on the baby yet it&#8217;s not too foamy. It&#8217;s the perfect &#8220;in between&#8221;.It&#8217;s easy to use! Put a bit in the palm of your hands, lather babies hair and body, rinse and dry baby off. I do like the smell of this. It reminds me of when I was younger, at the beach with all the smells of everyone wearing sunscreen.This product can be used from birth, onwards. The value for a 750ml bottle is approximately $22.00 USD.",4,1
Dermo-Cleansing 500ml. (16.90 FL OZ),"After recommendation when I was pregnant with my daughter from a friend who works as a babysitter for a certain celebrity, I decided  to use the Mustela line of products on her skin from birth. I must say it is remarkable and I am very happy this information was shared with me and I have to share it with all! THis body wash will have your baby feeling ssilky smooth and please do complement this with the body lotion as well..everyone will comment on how lovely your baby's skin is! On my older son, when I didnt know about the product, I used aveeno and I have to tell you it doesnt compare to this!!",5,1
Dermo-Cleansing 500ml. (16.90 FL OZ),We've been using this (and several other Mustela products) on our twins since they were born and never had any reaction to it (they're 18 months). A little goes a long way. It's mild and i have never been bothered by the scent.,5,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"Our daughter LOVES her exersaucer!  She is almost five months old and has been using it for about 2 months now.  She is a bigger baby (26"""" & 18#) and it is a great fit!  She plays in it every day for several hours!  I highly recommend it for your little one!",5,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"My son is ten months old and LOVES this exersaucer! He did a long stint in the hospital so developmentally he's a little behind for his age, but this toy is keeping his interest and helping him strengthen his core. He's a big boy too, and he has plenty of room to grow. We absolutely love it, money well spent.",5,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,I absolutely love this saucer.  I looked at so many of them before I finally decided on this one and I am so glad that I did a comparison.  No other saucers holds a candle to this one. It folds up so that I can easily stick in the trunk and take it where ever I go and clean up is a breeze! My 6 months old loves to sit and play in the saucer and we have the most fun watching him explore and get all excited over all the toys that are there.  It's like a small playground for him. I would never recommend any other Exersaucer. Smartsteps Entertainer is perfect!,5,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"my daugher is almost 8 months now and she has had this toy for a couple of months and its the only toy she will stay in for long periods of time usually between 20-40 mins and believe me for a baby that likes to be held all the time even 20 mins is good she enjoys it and it entertains her.  All the toys come off too so even when she is not in the bouncer she can still play with the toys, I think the johnny jumper is a bit too rough on her little legs and she does not enjoy it as much as the exersaucer. another good thing is it spins so she is not forced to be facing one position she really does spin around in it.  I will say the bad thing about it is that it is not easy to fold down at all I tried a few times and have just given up. But if you dont plan on taking it any where then you should not have to worry.",4,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"Bought this toy when my baby was 3 month old, she loved it right away. Now she is 5 months and plays in it couple of times in a day.All toys are easy to reach and grasp, seat is very comfy and easy to rotate.Love this product.",5,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"Entertainer is the right name for this toy. Our granddaughter is 4 months old and when all else fails she loves to play in this toy. It's amazing to watch the progress she makes in playing with this. It is expensive, but worth every penny.",5,1

Sassy Baby's First Rattle and Teether 5 Piece Gift Set,"Unique set, very nice.  My niece likes the, granted she's a bit small to let me know but I can see it in her eyes.  Very colorful and each one is different, Highly recommend for baby!",4,1
Waverly Petite Rose - Crib Bumper,"I LOVE THIS CRIB SET SOOO MUCH!! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND DIFFERENT. YOU DONT' HAVE THE COMMON PINK MOST CRIB SETS COME IN. THE MATCHING DUSTRUFFLE, RECEIVING BLANKETS AND QUILT JUST MAKES IT SO WONDERFUL. I WON'T CHANGE THIS SET FOR ANYTHING ELSE. :O)",5,1
Sassy Bird Toy Organizer,"I bought this toy organizer for my 8-month old son.  It holds A LOT of toys, and is very convenient for travel.  With its bright colors and peek-a-boo flaps, it also serves as a toy in itself.  My only complaint is that it came rather smashed into a box and still hasn't quite regained it's shape.  Great gift idea.",4,1
Safety 1st Grip 'n Go Walker,"This walker is light and easy to maneuver, my grand-daughter is free to roam now, and she likes the toys on the tray too.  The clear tray fascinates her when shes parked...resting",5,1
Safety 1st Grip 'n Go Walker,"I was a bit skeptical to buy this walker after the video review that someone had posted but I went ahead and bought it anyway after checking it out in the store.When it arrived, we did have some trouble putting it together (the same problem area as the guy in the video).  However, my husband was able to snap it in (it took some maneuvering, some tools, and a few choice swear words) and has been fabulous ever since then.  We've put all our weight on it, pulled and pushed, carried it by the problem leg and it hasn't budged.  So it is secure once you snap it in correctly.What I love most about this walker is how safe it is.  The base is wide enough so that it can't tip forward and the best part is that if the wheels are off kilter even a tiny bit, the walker stops dead in it's tracks and can't be moved.  Even going from the kitchen tile to the living room carpet (there is about an inch height difference), it stops and has to be physically lifted off the ground and carried into the next room. As with everything, you should always supervise your child when in a walker, but it makes me feel safe that if I turn my back to throw something out, I know he isn't going to go flying.It doesn't roll so good on the carpet, but then again what does?  I know there is some debate about the use of walkers, but since my son can't walk yet without holding on (he cruises like a pro), this is a really great way for him to be independent of us.  I'm glad I bought it.",4,1
Kolcraft Cuddle n' Care Bassinet,This thing was easy for me to put together while alone with the baby and I don't think I used any tools.  It works really well and seems to be really well thought out.  There are little wheels at the bottom that will pop inside to make it into a rocker.  There's a mesh basket at the bottom for storage.  It takes regular bassinet sheets.  I bought a 2-pack of another brand and it works perfect.  Everything is washable too.,5,1
Kolcraft Cuddle n' Care Bassinet,me and my husband are going to be parents next month and we already bought a bassinet 4 our coming baby but yesterday wen we went to target 4 shopping we saw this beautiful bassinet with all the features my husband was looking for in a very reasonable price so we decided jst after giving a first look that this is the one were looking for.we buy it and remove the one which we bought earlier from baby's room.it has very delicate and luxurious look WE SIMPLY LOVE ALL ITS FEATYRES.,5,1
Kolcraft Cuddle n' Care Bassinet,"Sent this to my sister for her new baby boy, she is still raving about how much they love it. He was 3 weeks early so I ordered it the day he was born(aternoon CA time) and even though they live in the middle of nowhere if still got there the next day( I paid for overnight, but it wasn't scheduled to arrive until Monday) So I was very happy, it got ""home"" before he did!",5,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,I borrowed this play center from a friend to have as a spare at my mother's house...i have the ExerSaucer mega circus at my house...my daughter will only spend a few minutes in the exersaucer but stays hours in the baby einstein...she never seems to get bored...i went with the exersaucer because it was reasonable and highly rated...boy do i wish i spent the extra money because the Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer is a lifesaver...,5,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"Bought this for our 5 month old and he's still loving it at 7 months.  It is the way that I get to cook dinner, so I love it too!  However, it's not perfect.  FYI, the assembly instructions could be a bit better.  It's hard to figure out how to assemble the little stands that stablize the bottom saucer.  I had to call the manufacturer for help.  The holes dont match up but I learned that's because Graco, the manufacturer, uses the same saucer on several different toys so the holes are actually for a different application.  The same little stands (or legs) don't stay clicked into place, so I've given up and we let the saucer just rock.  I did ask Graco to send another set, which they said they would do.  We're waiting for those to arrive.  In addition, our boy loves the puppet, but it's not the easiest to operate.  The hole in the back just doesnt seem to be angled right and it's hard to make your fingers fit to properly move the mouth. I'd have given it 5 stars if I didnt have to spend so much time futzing with the stands and calling the manufacturer.",4,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"I don't know what people are complaining about with this exersaucer.  Yes, the seat is hard to remove, but most of them are.  And the lady complaining about it being hard to break down and transport, I don't think this product was made to transport from one place to another.  I wouldn't have bought it if it were easy to take apart, to me, that would not be safe.  My son is 11 months old and we have had this since he was 6 weeks old and he still plays in it occasionly.  The tray is easy to wipe down and it has lots of stuff to keep baby busy.",4,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"We bought this for our 6-month-old son not because of the ""Baby Einstein"" brand, but because it only had one battery-powered feature out of nine items around the circle for him to play with.  Our son had not really taken to many ""gadgets"", i.e. his bouncy seat, swing, etc. until we bought this.  It keeps his attention, he can chew on most of the toys (a big plus as he is teething) and he always smiles when we put him in it.One (wierd) aside, the triangle top on the three-shaped stacked toy has a realistic picture of a fire-engine on it with engine number ""69"" prominently displayed on its front.  Maybe this is just my adult mind running wild, but is this some kind of sick joke by the company, or only a coincidence???  I didn't find it funny, or cute, or however they intended it or not...Other than that negative, it is well designed and our son loves it.",4,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is a wonderful toy. Our 7 month old daughter has been enjoying this since she turned 4 months old.  We bought it because she loved the ones similar to it at her day care.  She is entertained  for upwards of 30 minutes.  It is sturdy and I feel very comforable with her in it. There is plenty of room to grow but still gives her stabilizing support while she learns to balance and support her upper body.  It was more expensive than most of the others but the quality of this product is well worth it.  I have washed the seat a number of times and I clean it with lysol and it shows NO signs of wear at all, its like new!",4,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,I would recommend this product to parents.  Baby Einstein always has great products and my little boy loves his entertainer.  He likes the bright colors and the Bard the Dragon puppet is his favorite.,5,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is the one of the best things we've bought our baby. She absolutely loves it. She will stay in it playing for long periods of time without getting bored. It's the only thing I can put my baby in that will give me time to do other things around the house. She's even tired of the swing and bouncy seat. We got it when she was only 4 months old, and even at that young age, we could adjust it so her feet could reach the bottom. We slowly over the days watched her become more and more interested and interactive w/the toys. All of the toys are safe and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this over the exersaucers as I have had friends who haven't been as pleased with those. This is definitely worth every penny!!",5,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"The design is simple, the toys are not interchangable, but my son goes NUTS in this thing!  We tried the more expensive Exersaucer and he couldn't be in it more than 5 minutes before growing tired of it.  At 4 months he doesn't completely ""fill"" the seat yet and the height is at the lowest setting so he will definitely grow into this.The toys are creative and the layout is appealing allowing little one to enjoy each toy fully.  The colors are vibrant and complementary.  The materials are high quality and interesting to the touch.Don't be fooled by the simplistic look of this toy, Graco/Baby E know what they are doing.  This play center is a winner!",4,1
Mini Co-Sleeper,"I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It's perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do.  Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room.  Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average.  They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper.",4,1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"We started using this bed rail for each side of her bed (don't forget to order TWO- it only comes with one) since she left the crib. We believe this has saved her from falling countless times. She is old enough now to even tell us so. She doesn't want them off, even though it makes climing in and out of bed more of a hassle for her. Excellent product at an excellent price!",5,1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Although the safety strap is a bit difficult to figure out how to tighten, the ""legs"" that go between the mattress and box spring do a fine job of holding it in place even when our 35 lb toddler is wedged up against it.  Love that it folds down almost all the way-another inch and it would.  This works perfectly and gives about a foot of room of open space at the head and about 18 in by the foot(where the step stool goes) on a full size ""big kid"" bed.",4,1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Got this rail for our 2 year old's full size bed.  It is sturdy and while we don't encourage her to push on it, we have confidence that it will not break, especially with the extra bar in place.  The locking mechanism is easy to use and lowering the rail is simple and smooth.  We don't see that it would be any better to have the rail slide under the mattress - seems we probably wouldn't do that very often. The only downside is that the mesh got a small hole in it rather quickly.  Not sure how it happened, but we would have liked a mesh that was a bit more tear resistant.  Have to see how that holds up, but this rail has served us well so far.",4,1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"I bought this bed rail to use on a twin bed I purchased for our granddaughter to use when she stays with us.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that will only be used a couple of times a year, so this bed rail caught my eye.  It looks really nice, was easy to put together and gives really good coverage.  I highly recommend it!",5,1

"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Initally when the baby came home from the hospital, I used this product as a bassinet.  However, after a few sleepless weeks, I placed the portable sleeper in the bed in between me and my husband.  Since then, the baby has been sleeping like a champ!!  It's so easy to check on him in the middle of the night.  I don't know what I'd do without this product!",5,1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I am very happy with our purchase. We have a few weeks before we get someone in there, but we like it so far! It is larger than I was expecting, which is great! It is a bit more wobbly that I expected, which is not so great. The fabric cannot come off of the bassinet to be washed, so I'm a little bit unhappy with that. However, it's SO cute and I just can't wait to use it!",4,1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I love this, I bought this for my daughter and her new little one and it has turned out to be so handy. It's perfect.",5,1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I do like this bassinet. I think it's beautiful. I think it's very functional. I like that I can fold it up and take it with me as a travel piece and it's so much easier than messing with a pack and play. This bassinet though is a good foot higher than our standard bed. So I still have to sit up to get baby out. No big deal to me though, really. I also can't imagine taking bassinet out just to use the changing station, but it's there if you need it I guess. It is also fairly heavy. I think it's heavier than our infant carseats, or close to it. Add a baby in there and there's is no way I am carrying baby from room to room in that thing. Other than that though, it is a sturdy, functional bassinet.",4,1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","First of all it looks absolutely beautiful! I was searching for a bassinet for a few months before I had my son and this one was my final choice and I am very happy about it.  I've seen many other bassinets and I simply didn't even feel comfortable putting my baby into those. We had our son in this bassinet all the way up until her gained 17 pounds. It was nice and convenient to have him right next to my bed and if he was sleeping I could just pick up the top part and move him with me. As a new mother I was getting up see if he is breathing every time I thought he was too quiet. So believe me, that nightlight was used ALL THE TIME. The running water and birds sounds were very soothing for me and the baby. I also loved the feature that you could turn the wheels and rock the bassinet. If you live in a little apartment every inch of space is valuable and the storage basket was very helpful too. The only thing I didn't use was the changing table. So, don't think that this is only for a little time and it costs too much money - it's worth every penny and you'll probably use it for about 4 months. Enjoy it the way we did :)",5,1
Neat Solutions 20 Count Dora The Explorer Table Topper Disposable Stick-On Placemats,"absolutely love this product, is definitely a must have if you have little ones and like to go out to eat. If you don't want to worry when their hands touch the restaurant's table surface, you need this.

They really thought this one out!",5,1
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"My daughter has been in love with the Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Musical Gym since she was only a couple of weeks old. I think I owe my sanity to this play mat. Ava was the type of newborn who needed to be held at all times. Needless to say it was impossible to get anything done around my house. Until I decided to give this play mat a try. It was the only way she was content when I put her down. She couldn't be bothered with her swing or bouncy seat or anything. She loved the cause and effect she got from batting at the bird with her hands or from kicking her feet. The movement causes the bird to chirp, flap its wings,swing back and forth and play music and lights. It makes her very excited. The hanging toys are a great quality and can be moved to change it up to avoid boredom.  She is now 5 months old and continues to discover  new ways to play with this toy. I bring it EVERYWHERE with me, including the beach. She has found new toys she like as well but continues to enjoy this one just as much as she always has. She loves it so it was a life saver for me. She has a different one at my mother-in-laws house but is not as interested in that one. 5 stars all the way!",5,1
Flutterbye Deluxe Soft Gym,"I FIRST GOT THIS OUT FOR MY SON AT 4 WKS AND HE SEEMED DISINTERESTED. I BROUGHT IT OUT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER AND HE SEEMED MUCH MORE INTERESTED. AT FIRST HE JUST STARED AT THE BIRD, THEN HE STARTED GRABBING AND KICKING AT THE HANGING TOYS. HE LAUGHS AND SMILES AND HAS LOTS OF FUN. THERE ARE TWO SMALL PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS TOY:1)IT SEEMS LIKE THE TOYS THAT HANG ON THE LOOPS EITHER HANG TOO LOW OR TOO HIGH. I HAD TO ADJUST THE TOYS TO MAKE TYHEM THE RIGHT HEIGHT. 2) AFTER A WEEK, THE BIRDS HEAD CAME OFF. IT REATTACHED EASILY, BUT IT FALLS OFF EASILY TOO.",4,1
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"I would recommend this carrier to anyone. I have no problem with back pain or the carrier not fitting and I am small framed(5'4""""). I use it mostly with my baby on my back since I use it when I work and it is akward to work around my baby. Both my babies still fit into it and I can be comfortable for hours. My only complaint is that it is falling apart. The stitching is actually pulling out! I won't replace it since my youngest baby is not far from walking and I don't use it often for my older baby but I wish it would have lasted longer because it is so great. I have had it for about 19 months and used it at least 2-3 days a week. It was impossible to use during the last 2 months of my pregnancy w/baby #2 but my husband used it alot as well.",4,1
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"When Nathan was first born, this carrier was our way to soothe him when nothing else worked!  My husband or I would place him in the carrier and walk -- putting Nathan to sleep!As months passed, we discovered many other ways this carrier was handy.  I use it to get housework done, Nate helps me make cookies in it, we walk together, and he is much happier for longer periods of time in the store in this than he is in the cart.  For alert babies that are happiest to see what is going on, this is the way to go!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,1
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,I received the soother while I was pregnant with my daughter and have used it at naptime and bedtime EVERY DAY since.  I don't even travel without it.  My daughter will be one in February and she is now able to control the music on her own.  She will literally get up during the night and turn her music on and go back to sleep.  This toy has been an absolute life saver.  Every mother to be should have one!,5,1
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"My daughter at 11 months is transitioning to her crib. I really liked the old fisher price aquarium but can't find it anywhere. So, for the past 2 weeks I have been rocking her to sleep but she insists on moving around to keep herself awake. After about 20 minutes I just lay her in her crib and she screams and cries. I decided to buy a crib toy in hopes to sooth herself to sleep. I had 3 choices placed in front of me and I decided to go with the Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies. No more crying! She loves the light show, I must admit that it is cute and the music is relaxing. She also plays with it in the morning giving me extra sleep time--that's ALWAYS a bonus! I certainly recommend at least trying it out. I just hope that it lasts longer than several months, which is what one review stated.*Updated* Almost a year later and the toy is going strong. The only downfall is that it does suck batteries but that's to be expected with the movement, lightshow, AND music. I'm glad I invested into it.",5,1
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"I bought this because my daughter enjoyed her Aquarium crib toy for so long, that I thought she would like birds for a change, and it had such good reviews.It's very cute, but I think the aquarium one is much more soothing with the bubbles and the fish.  Maybe it's me, but I think aquarium sounds are more relaxing than chirping birds.I had to mount this on the wall side of the crib because if I mounted it on the other side, a ceiling fixture got in the way.  If the crib is too close to the wall, you can't see the whole light show.  Part of it is lost on the wall, so I was a little disappointed in that.The on/off button is kind of small compared to the aquarium, and it's off to one side as opposed to in the middle.  It was very easy for my daughter to just put her hand out and turn her aquarium on by herself in the middle of the night when she needed to be soothed back to sleep, but this button is hard to find by a baby.I guess I'll keep it because it is cute, but I'm definitely leaving the aquarium in her crib too.",4,1
Fisher-Price: Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother,"We recieved this as a gift for my one year old son after the original aquarium broke.  Even though my 1 year old likes it, my 4 year old loves it even more.  Since they share a room, this soothes both of them to sleep but if my younger one falls asleep before the older one, the older one gets up and turns this on to watch the ceiling show.  The projection is very clear and the music is nice.  My 1 year old turns this on himself to hear the music and watch the birds move around.  And after my son outgrows this as a crib toy, I can use it on a table in their room so they can still enjoy it.  I think this is even better than the original (2001) fisher price aquarium since the image on the ceiling is better and the birds are so cute.",5,1
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I did some research on the different carriers before deciding on this one. It was the cheapest I could find and also looked like the most practical. I have a 2 month old daughter and she loves it! Within minutes of walking she's out like a light and looks extremely comfortable. The leg holes aren't too tight, there's adequate space for her arms and it supports her head wonderfully. Now I don't have to lug the stroller around everywhere and can also get stuff done around the house without her crying to be held!",5,1
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"This carrier is better than the Baby Bjorn. I returned the other one so I could by the Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier. It is light weight, extremely easy to put on and even easier to put your baby in. My daughter loves being in the snugli.

When I had my third my oldest was only 2 1/2 so to keep my sanity we had to get out of the house, but I wasn't quite up to the task of an infant, toddler and one walking toddler,nor was I about to spend several hundred dollars on a thriple stroller to use for such a short period of time,  so I buckled the two older kids up and put my youngest in this (Which stayed in the basket when not in use).

The cost may seem steep for some and the environmentalist in me wants to say ""no"" to additional paper/plastic products, but by the time I get done toliet papering the seat or using enough tissue covers to make it comfortable for my girls I have wasted more than using just one of these seat covers.  Extra tip that we found when we were potty training our little ones, we also ripped the potty seat cover off the toliet seat when done and placed on the floor to stand on the face-up side while putting our pants or pull-ups back on, no yucky restroom floor in sock/bare feet!",5,1

No more tripping over the base of the high chair. Very compact, easy to clean, portable if  you want to travel with it. Like I said a must have!",5,1

Fisher-Price: Peek-A-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse,My daughter will crawl to this toy no matter where it is in the room as long as she knows it's there. It does make a lot of noise if the balls are being used but my daughter usually likes it without the balls. Her favorite part is stopping the spinning wheels with her hands. I like that there's a red button to activate the toy without having to put a ball in the hole at the top since at 9 months she's hasn't learned to do that yet. I do worry about her trying to use it for balance now that she's standing up. I wouldn't recommend leaving this toy with a child trying to stand or walk.,5,1
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I have always had issues with shoulder belts.  They hit me in the neck, not the shoulder.

Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I'm one of those people who is always aggravated by seat belts, whether my own or being in someone else's vehicle. I usually use a quilted wrap to keep from rubbing my skin near my neck, but it shifts or the closure ends up irritating my skin.Heininger's Automotive CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster has given me the near perfect relief. It took me two tries to get it attached correctly. The first time I put it in backwards. While it still worked fine, it caused my belts to twist and tangle incorrectly. I had to remove the clamp which was a real pest to detach. Once so, I flipped it around and got it attached correctly.Once in place, I was very happy with relief it provided. My seat belt no longer rides high on my collarbone. Nice! Using it the next time I climbed in the car showed how effortless it is to reclip the seat belt and keep the belt off my collarbone. Only then, at first, I didn't like how I can feel the plastic adjuster against my hips. I quickly forgot about as I started to drive.One thing I noticed the second time around is that you can't keep the strap adjuster more than just a few inches away from the buckle, otherwise the seat belt straps where they're clipped at begin to ride high and lay against your midsection rather than low at your hips. The instructions do state not to use the adjuster more than just a few scant inches away from the seat belt buckle - now I know why. The seat belts will raise up and away from your lap if you do.Pros:- Provides the relief needed from seat belts riding high.- Easy to install (once you figure out the short installation instructions).- You get two of them.Cons:- Rides high if the adjuster slides too far away from the buckle.- The bulkiness of the belt can be felt and may be a tad uncomfortable for some people.Overall, I'm happy with Heininger Commutemate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster. It's given me the relief I needed to drive comfortably, especially with longer distances.",4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag,"I bought this bag as a ""quick trip"" bag for my one month and 2.5 year old girls.  I got it specifically for the purpose of making a quick trip to the grocery store, doctors office, or a quick lunch out with the girls.  I don't want to carry my gargantuan full size bag everywhere.  It suits this purpose very well - and then some.I can fit a capped bottle pre-filled with water in the bottle carrier, plus extra drop-ins and nipples. (I use the Playtex drop-in bottles so if I need more than one bottle out, I just pack extra nips and liners)  In the top portion, I can fit a full pack of travel wipes (Huggies or pampers on the go sets), 3 small diapers (sz 1) and 2-3 larger diapers (sz 4)  I can also usually slide my wallet in this section.In the middle compartment, I have a onsie and pants and a receiving blanket, and several small toys for my toddler (some plastic dinosaurs, tiny cars, and 2 small playdoh packs and a plastic knife for cutting them up)In the bottom section, I have a container for powdered formula and a scoop, a disposable diaper bag container, and usually a bagged snack for the toddler (goldfish or cheerios)On the front I carry my keys in the top pocket, and sanitizer and spare socks in the longer compartment.  In the bottom, I carry a pack of gum and a pen.This bag works great for us, its easy to get on and off, easy to clean, and holds quite a bit.  We've had it in use for a month, and I love it!  Plus - my husband doesn't mind carrying it, which is always a bonus.  I've seen some reviews that say the lining tears between compartments.  So far I've seen no seams ripping, and we use it almost every day.  We're pretty hard on bags - ie: I even wore it comfortably on amusement park style rides at the state fair with my 2yo.  I hope not to see any issues on this, but at this cost - its well worth replacing if it does.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,We originally ordered this bag so that my husband wouldn't feel like he was using a purse for a diaper bag.  I fell in love with it too. It is hands free and there is a place for my wallet and cell phone.  This bag is perfect for short trips or a meal out.  All the separate compartments really keep you organized.  The only problem we had was the stitching on the outer flap of the diaper compartment was too close to the edge and the material starting fraying and essentially falling apart.  I loved the bag so much that I thought I would give it another try and have not had any problems with the new one.  I am hoping that it was just a fluke.  I prefer this bag over my other 2 diaper bags HANDS DOWN.,4,1
Tigger High Back Chair,"My son recv'd this as a Christmas gift from his grandparents. At first I thought it was a little junky (and it does look junky with the blue fake fur), but my son loves it! He's three and it's just the right size for him. He watches all of his favorite movies in his special little chair.I have a 20 pound cat named King Mo who spends his spare time in the chair when my son isn't using it. Apprently, he's holding court what with Tigger on the chair and all. It's quite funny to walk into the living room and see a mountain of housecat sprawled out in the seat and over the arm of this little toddler chair!The cover is removable and washable. It zippers on and off. Be sure to air dry this one, though, or you'll have blue fur in your dryer for weeks.This chair also makes a nice footstool to prop up your feet under the computer desk. ;)",5,1

You can't beat the price either.  I am very happy with this stroller!",5,1
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,We went looking on line trying to find the best double stroller. We have a 18 month old and one on the way. We found this one online and went to toys r us to look at it. We loved it. The cup holder is pretty useless. But we don't care. Target had Amy Coe Diaper bags that had stroller attachment straps. I went and bought one we tried it out went back two days later for another. We even went to Taste of Minnesota with this stroller and both bags and it worked great. THe Amy Coe bags have great storage and work great with this Stroller. I tried lifting other strollers at toysrus and the were just too heavy and awkard. This one is a little light but not so awkward to lift. The latch for keeping it locked is too long. We are thinking maybe a bunjee cord so it can close tighter. It is really easy to close. We love it and so does our 18 month old,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","The really cool thing about this chair is that it's big and strong enough for my older child to sit comfortably.  As for the baby, I usually don't leave him in there because the toys aren't interesting and he wants to get out.  However, I do kick out the bottom piece that holds it steady instead of rocking, and I've been using it to feed him.  The cover is really easy to remove for cleaning, and the fabric doesn't fade in the wash.  I've probably washed it 15 times in four months (baby food, you know...) and it comes out looking brand new.  Vibration is noticeable but not jackhammer-like, like so many other chairs.  Soothing.I wish it folded up a little more for storage, but it's not a big deal.  Four stars instead of five because the toys are boring; no music or lights, etc.  So it's not really interesting for a very young baby.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This rocker is truly versatile and will have a much longer usage time than a regular bouncy seat. My now 4-month old daughter loved the chair as a newborn - we'd put the kickstand up and she was really comfortable there. During a lot of those long first nights, she'd spend almost all night in the chair as it wrapped her a little more tightly than if she was just in her crib.Now that she's a little older, she loves sitting in this chair while the family has dinner or while I prepare dinner - she can check everything out.I would agree the toy bar is flawed in that the cow faces outward. We've 'fixed' that by hanging the string/velcro upside down (hard to explain!) - makes it a little less stable than it otherwise would be, but so far it's working well.I sure wish I'd had this seat for my now 2 1/2 year old! The seat we had then sat far too upright for a newborn, so we couldn't even use it until he was about 3 months old, and he quickly outgrew it. In fact, we sometimes find our son sitting in his little sister's rocker, though at 32 pounds and 36 inches tall, he's a little too big.All in all, a really great buy - good price and terrific product.",5,1

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.",5,1

He is 6 weeks old now and I was so glad I had this and it was already put together when we brought him home.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We received this as a gift at our baby shower.  My son, who is now almost 3, has used it since the day he was born and continues to love it.  The fact that it is adjustable is wonderful too.  He was a big baby, and had outgrown the baby bouncers by the time he was just a couple of months, this he still enjoys using.I also run a daycare and every child loves that rocker.  Ours is old and warn and we'll probably have to get another with our next child, but it has held up through three years of daily use by multiple children, you really can't expect much more than that.  I have found that there is a stretch of time from the time a baby starts crawling until they start walking that the chair really isn't the best.  At this age they have the coordination to wiggle themselves to the point they fall out.  Most babies seem to be able to get out on their own safely by the time they start walking though.  We almost put it away when we hit that stage and I'm so glad we didn't!Charlene",5,1

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We bought this chair for our son before he was born because we liked that it would be useful longer than the regular bouncers.

So, I would put him in the chair and turn on the vibrations and immediatly he would be happy again.  The chair does take one D battery but it has lasted forever for us.Our son liked to rock so we never used the chair with the kickstand out until recently.  He is now 7 1/2 months old and like other reviews, he sits up and I was afraid that he would fall completely over.  So, I put the kickstand out and he still likes to lay in it for a little while.  The toy bar and toys have been great too.  Our son has always liked the toys and still plays with them, even sometimes when he is not in the chair.We will have to see how he does with the toddler rocker later.  He is tall so I don't think he will have some of the problems other people are having with it.Overall, I think this chair was a great investment and would buy it again if given the opportunity.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This bouncer is GREAT! My son was 3 weeks old when we started using it and he LOVES it... At times, he wouldnt sleep in his crib or his bassinet so we were able to pick up the seat and put it inside his crib and he slept peacefully... This is a great seat and it's the best bouncer I've come across...",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have been very happy with this rocker.  My son was born a month ago, and almost from the time we brought him home, we have been able to use the rocker and he seems to be pretty happy sitting in there.  He recently started staring very intently at the little toys and the black-and-white bar they dangle from.  He doesn't control his arms yet, but I'm sure he'll be swatting at the toys soon.  This rocker is much more affordable than some others I looked at, but it seems very sturdy and I like that you can either set it up to rock or put down the kickstand and have it stay put.  It's also fairly light, so we can easily move it from one room to another.  Of all the gear we purchased for the baby, this is one of the items that has gotten the most use.  I would definitely recommend it to other new parents.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This seat is awesome.  My daughter had the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders one (it was left over from my son) and she hated it.  She couldn't reach any of the toys.  In this seat she's more upright and can kick to rock & can also grab the toy in the middle that sings.  She loves to watch the butterflies """"dance"""" when she makes the chair rock and the vibrations are perfect.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Great chair! My son loves this chair! I love how you can use it as a rocker for more than a few months. It can grow with him.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We received this seat as a gift for our newborn and thank God we did.  Our little guy would not sleep on his back or side at first so, like our oldest son, we set him in his carrier to sleep all bundled up.  We started using this seat for sleeping after we opened it.  It sits like a popasun seat.  Just wonderful for those babies that love to be cuddled.  Now he is seven months old and sits up in the seat and rocks while watching his show or while we need a minute to get soemthing doen and need the comfort of knowing that he is in a safe place.  It really is a great seat.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is great!  At first it was a little big for my newborn but he started to like it more and more as he got bigger!  Hes now 14 months old and still uses this chair! He loves to sit in it while he watches cartoons etc. A definate great buy!  When he was a little younger he loved the toybar, but has no use for it now.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Bought this and had it sent to my granddaughter for the baby.  Loves the seat and would recommend it.  My daughter has one that has been used by three babies and theey love to use it as a rocking chair.  They will not outgrow it for a long time.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My son loved this seat as an infant.  The toys captured his attention and he liked the vibration feature.  He used it daily (even napping in it) until he was about 5 months old.  After that he was too wiggly for it.  He uses it now a little bit as a rocking chair but the real use we got out of it was when he was a baby.  Still, for as much as it helped us when he was a baby, it was worth getting!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We love this chair for baby and she seems to like it as well. It is awesome that it is portable and can be moved from room to room, unlike the swing. I was disappointed it cost so much to ship, especially when I found it at the local Walmart for the same price.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",The twins i watch have this chair amoung others and they are 7 months and have started to outgrow the others but they still love this one and fit in it. when they where little they used to sleep in the chair for naps.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Love this chair but the only thing fisher price should do is add a 5 point adjustable harness because my child twice almost flipped over as she was in the curious stage and not yet ready to use it as a toddler rocker but we used it a lot.  Great px and buy.,4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This is a great toddler bed and rocker.  The baby sits in it safely and not bent too much and looks very safe.  I am very pleased with this purchase and very pleased shopping with Amazon!!!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I have purchased so many of these little chairs for new Mom's.  You can use it until they are 2 years old and they love sitting in it to watch TV or eat or just """"hang out"""".  I would definitely recommend this for every new Mom.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",excelent,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We purchased this chair to use on vacation with family so we didn't have to ship our bouncy chair out and back. Now I wish we had this one at home. It's great! Not only was it comfortable for our infant (3 months), but my 2.5 year old took a nap in it too! There's definitely value in something both my kids can use.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This chair is awesome for any age kids My 3 year old still like to sit in it, so money well spent if it can last that long!!!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Just Right!!! my son will have this for a long time.  Very cute and not too big.  Vibration is at a comfortable level.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Our 2 1/2 month old son likes to sit in this seat and stare at the toys, but he doesn't care for the vibration like he does in his other bouncer.  This seat is easy to clean, fairly easy to move from room to room, and versatile.  It's not that attractive, however.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My baby likes rocking in this rocker, toys keep her entertained, just wished the vibrator was little better like it could rock the rocker instead of just vibrating which baby didnt even realize anything is happening. Color looks great, music is nice, material good, assembly easy.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",For my baby not yet to born. Colorful and soft. My baby will like this and sitting and playing the toys.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",My baby love it. He is very like to sit on it and easy to fell sleeping. And it's can sit for many years. So I like it too.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",the vibration and rocking effect soothe my baby. she looked happy on it. best buy in amazon. the cushion is soft to touch and fine with baby's fragile skin. easy to assemble. definitely worth buying.,5,1
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural",When we were putting the changing table together we were given two part Cs instead of a part C and part D. Because of this one side of the changing table is missing for now. I went onto the Badger website. Not only are they sending me the part for free they're also giving me a 20% off my next order with them. I'm impressed that they handle their customer service so fast (within an hour of me sending in my complaint). I will continue to buy from them. They have my respect for fixing the problem right away and being very friendly as well.,4,1
"Badger Basket Diaper Corner Changing Table, Natural","We bought this based on shape and reviews. We use it for an 18 month old and newborn, and it's great for both. The shape fits into corners and gives you an easier angle to do the 'job'. The shelves are convenient for storing and keeping handy all diaper and clothing changing equipment, even though some will complain they are thin, flimsy boards- we are taking about diapers, not a garage for cars.The shape makes for a very stable table, and the mat fits on nicely- although the screws to attach it to the table are not too lasting. But then again, where would the mat run?All in all a great changing table, with the only change I would make would be to enclose the storage shelves so the older children wouldn't have a field day undoing all your organizing.",5,1
Wood Frame Hamper with Blue Gingham,Hamper is just what I expected. A nice little surprise is that it came with a inside bag that you can easily remove and take to the washer and dryer.,4,1
Sassy Flower Pop Up Organizer,"I wanted this for my little girl's room, it's smaller than I expected (my fault, I should have paid more attention to the dimensions). It's also not as vibrant as I was expecting it to be, but still nice enough. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a laundry basket or toy basket for their kid's room.",4,1
Sassy Water Pop Up Organizer,this product is great! it is bigger than i thought so we can fit so many toys in there. its full of color so my boy was excited when he saw it and it kinda motivated him to put his toys away in it. the only drawback is that the zipper doesnt open all the way around it only goes halfway through the circle but its not too much of a bother. i would really recommend this!,4,1
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"Used this for both my babies and each one responded to this toy like no other. When they were only a few weeks old and didnt pay attention to much at all, this was the only thing that got them smiling and excited.Recommended this to tons of friends as well and was a hit with everyone.Contrary to some neg comments, the clip is very very strong and has always hung on our stroller canopy with no issues",5,1
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"Bought this and almost returned it once I saw it in person.  It looks like the simplest, dinkiest (although well constructed) thing.  And then the music is this tinkly classical loop of about 4 classical songs.  I opened it up, turned it on, and my 5 week old baby lit up.  He LOVES the quality of the music.  I don't know which frequencies babies hear differently, but apparently Tiny Love does.  He likes this more than his real mobile in his crib.PLUSES: hangs anyhwere - velcro was very strong in my opinion, has a clamp in addition to velcro strap, and most importantly DOESN'T TURN OFF UNTIL YOU TELL IT TO!  This is great.  Most mobiles require you to keep coming back and turning them on. It's so great that my only MINUS: wish it had a way to turn off the mobile function and just use it as a music box.  My method of doing this is that I turn it upside down and put it somewhere with enough room and just let it play in the baby's room as a never-ending music box.You might not be impressed, but your baby will like it if he/she's at all like my baby.",4,1
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"I love this.  It has a clip to hang it from a stroller, but for my car seat I just removed the large orange clip and it is the perfect height.  I use the lithium batteries and they seem to last the best.",5,1
Tiny Love Musical Take Along Arch - Ocean,"This is the only thing my son will coo and smile at on his carseat!  It hooked just fine to my infant seat.  The musical crab plays music when you shake it.  Even going over a bump in the road will activate it.  When it plays, my son will smile at it.  I love this toy.  It makes riding in the car enjoyable.",5,1
"Luvable Friends Thermal Knit Receiving Blanket, White",Great for swaddling and so soft.  Pretty color too!  There are cool enough for the summer but warm enough for the winter.,5,1
Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"I am impressed with these sheets, they fit my graco pack n play perfect, they are very soft, and they are just thick enough that you can not see the print of my pack n play mattress through them.",5,1

Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,I've been looking for portable sheets that will fit oversize mattresses.  I have a day care center and I am always in need of replacing portacrib/mini crib sheets.  I have tried several different brands of sheets & this is the only sheet that I've found that is affordable and that fits the 3 inch mattresses along with the 6 inch mattresses.,5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"After reading all of the product reviews, I decided to give this a try. So far, he so good. The sheets shrank to the perfect size for the 6&#34; mini crib mattress after one wash. We'll see how to holds up after multiple washes.",5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,this is just so SOFT... it is perfect! I admired their softness for 5 minutes once i got them.. couldn't believe how great this material is!!,5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,This is the only sheet I have found that fits my traditional DaVinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 coil mattress.It's thin but fits perfectly. I highly recommend buying a few.,4,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"I bought three of these for my Emily crib and have been using them for several months with no problem.  They wash well and are still soft, even though I don't use fabric softener of any sort.  I might mention two other things.  First, I am using them with the six inch innerspring mattress, which is not the 1.5&#34; mat that comes with the crib.  Also, I remember that when I first ordered, I saw that some patterns and colors cost more than others, even from the same vendor, so I ordered accordingly.",5,1
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"My son just turned one, and yes, I am now only experiencing the great joy of ""the perfect bag""! I had been using the black bag the hospital gave us when leaving the hospital. It served its purpose, but I definitely felt the need to get a new, more spacious (and of course, stylish) bag. I searched high and low, only to find those falling into the boring or overpriced category. Then one day when picking up a few things at Babies R Us, I happened upon this bag and stopped dead in my tracks. I LOVED it!! But, admittedly, when seeing the price, I waivered on it. Should I or shouldn't I? I must have held it for 15 minutes... and with a shrug of my shoulders, put it back. ""I'll think about it"", I said. Months passed and after even more unsuccessful searches, I decided, ""that's it, I'm buying it!"".  Very excited, with credit card in hand, I jumped online only to find that this bag was SOLD OUT everywhere and that there was a waiting list the size of I don't even know what. I couldn't believe it! Again, I would have to wait...My sister was shopping at Babies R Us the other day, saw it, called me, and within minutes I was there, in line and out the door... with my beautiful new bag! It's been about 2 weeks that I have been using it and I AM IN LOVE!!!Do not hesitate! The price my seem high at first, but really, it's a beautifuly, incredibly function, high quality bag. It holds all the necessities - for the both of us. I am no longer juggling multiple bags - a diaper bag for him and a purse for myself. Initially I was concerned that there was not a shoulder strap option, but it's not an issue. It fits so comfortably over my shoulder and nestles right under my arm... it doesn't slide - at all! And, most of all, this bag is all glam... it's gorgeous, feminine... a real looker! You've got to get it :)One final word if you're on the fence. If you hate heavy bags, this is probably not the one for you. When filled to capacity, it does get a bit heavy, BUT (yes, there is a but) it's nothing you can't handle. I still give this bag 5-Stars... it's amazing!!!!Alas, my search is over... thank you Wendy!!!",5,1
Safety 1st Lift And Lock Security Gate,"We live in an older home with uneven doors and originally bought a cheaper set of 2 (don't remember the brand). That's when we found out our doors are uneven and had to return those.We love, love, love this ""gate"" (our is the clear model). It comes with a mounting option, but if you don't want to screw anything onto your doorframe, it still works great without the mounting, you just won't be able to swing it open. If you choose not to mount, the gate suctions easily to any doorframe and becomes more portable to use anywhere else in the house.Another reviewer rated this gate on the fact that it can't swing if not mounted, that's common sense. This is a great gate and you don't even have to spend a lot!",5,1
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"If you are expecting a child, go out and buy this bouncer (if you haven't already). My daughter loves this bouncer, I started putting her in it at 3 months (there really is no support for a newborn's unstable head)and she was amazed at the bright lights, songs and vibrating seat. She kickes at the toys with her feet and then lets them fall down on the bouncer and it rewards her by playing a song. I love this bouncer and don't know what I would do without it, I can get my housework done and she is highly entertained and learning at the same time!",5,1
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"my baby loved it..she seem very comfy in it..when cranky,i place her in it and she relaxes,  she's not to upward..started using it as early as i can remeber..",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"My child wasn't sure about this seat at first, but over the last 2 1/2 months (she's almost 5 months now), she has fallen IN LOVE with this seat.  When I first set her in it, she squeals with delight and then her legs start going!  She will sometimes cry when I take her out of it!  It's a great place to put her while I make dinner or even if my arms just need a break!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"We already had a Combi Activity Rocker, but the toys on the Combi are all manual (meaning there's nothing a little baby without developed motor skills can just kick back and watch.) My girl was extremely demanding & I needed something to entertain her while I read my email or brushed my teeth. (I used to sit in front of her & play with the toys on the Combi for her, just to keep her calm.) I was at my wits end & then I found the Aquarium bouncer. I'd read good reviews, but still wasn't sure because it just seems so flimsy  & insubstantial compared to the Combi. Frankly, for the cheapness of the frame, I thought it was over-priced. But hey, whatever works!We were at the store & she started fussing. We were near the bouncers, so I grabbed the display model, put it on the floor & plopped her in. (There were actually batteries in the display model!) Instant difference. It went home with us & I finally got a little free time.A this point, she's 5 months & doesn't spend much time in it (she prefers to be upright & moving) but I still plop her in it in the bathroom while I get the tub ready every night & she still loves the music & those silly fish.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"From the time our baby was born, we haveplaced him in this bouncy seat. The vibratingmotion was soothing when he was a newborn.  He lovedthe aquarium bar and the noises/music it made.At first he would just watch it but eventually he wantedto put his face up against it.We have not used the seat since he was 8 or 9 months oldbecause once he became mobile he could not sit in itwithout going off the sides(because he wanted to stand) or becoming upset that he was strapped in. I highly recommend this seatfor the first 6 to 7 months, but watch your baby closely so that he/she does not fall off the sides or backwards as baby grows.Great soothing chair esp. if baby becomes colicky for long or short period of time.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"So far I've been really happy with the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer.  We'd been looking for a bouncy chair (no-frills) for when my daughter is a little older and just beginning to eat solids but at the suggestion of a friend, decided to take a look at this bouncer.  My daughter usually loves being put into the chair...it vibrates and she likes watching the bubbles and flashing lights.  I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the music (it's sort of cheesy and annoying) but obviously it's not for my benefit, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it, and anyway there are other sound options (e.g., ocean waves, rain drops) that are more calming.  While this chair is not my daughter's favorite contraption (her max toleration time is usually only about 10 minutes), it's nice to be able to put her in it for even just a short while to keep her occupied while I'm trying to take care of other brief tasks in the same room.  When my daughter is ready to start eating solids in a few months, our hope is that we can take the toy portion (with the bubbles) off, seat her in the chair and feed her.  Luckily the fabric can be removed and washed easily in the washing machine.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,This was and is a great choice.  My son has loved this seat since he was 8 weeks old.  He loves the bubbles and the kissing fish.  He is now 14 lbs and still using it daily for short term entertainment.This is easy to take apart to machine wash.,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"The produce is great, but the box was all bent up & I was unhappy because it was a gift.  I think things shipped should be in a box, not the original package.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,Whoever created this aquarium bouncer is a genius! My husband and I love it! Our daughter falls alseep to the soothing sounds and vibrations. She loves to focus her eyes on fish and laughs and smiles whenever she is in it. She is 2 months old and is already trying to squirm out of the seat. I hope she will be able to use it a little while longer.,4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I just CANT say enough good things about this toy!  If it weren't for this bouncer, I would NEVER be able to get ready in the morning if it weren't for this god send.  He loves the fish and the bubbles- He will sit and talk to his ""friends"" for over 30 minutes at times!  I definitely recommend this over some of the other bouncers.  He has one at his grandparents and one at his babysitters- The one at his grandparents is different, and he won't stay in it nearly as long-Definitely give this bouncer a try!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,I received this bouncer as a gift for my daughter.  From day one she loved it.  She's 5 months old now and it's still one of her favorites.  I put her in it every morning while I get ready for work and it keeps her busy the entire time.,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,This bouncer is the best thing that ever happened to us.  We began using it without the aquarium attachment as soon as my son came home from the hospital.  I was able to take showers with him in the bathroom in his bouncer and he was always fine.  Once we put the aquarium bar back on he was in heaven.  We take this on vacation and over to friends' houses because he can sit in it and entertain himself for hours.  He sits and watches the bubbles and the fish with amazement.  He is now almost four months and we still use it almost everyday!,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I have a 3 month old son, and he is in love with his bouncer. We got it as a shower gift, and are pretty glad!I find that with most of the aquarium line, its more along the lines for playing or for occupying your baby (bright colors, loud cheery music ect...) and thats what we use this bouncer forIts great for keeping my boy happy. The fish are so funny to him and he loves the mosic. It bounces nicely and my 2 1/2 year old even tryed sitting it (but after a stern warning has stayed clear ever since!) So its durable! I dont know how long we will be using this, our son is a premie, but in a month we will be looking for an exersaucer, or will be taking out our old one from the basement (thats probably whats gonna be happening!) So this is great for a newborn, but once your baby gets active, I think its time for more stimulation, although this will be around for about another month or so before it moves down to another expecting parent!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"We got this as a baby shower gift and just love it. We put my son in this since birth and he was always interested in it. He is now 2 1/2 months and still just loves this toy. The only problem was that after 1 month the vibrator part just got sooooo loud. Since we got it as a gift we did not have a receipt but Babies """"R"""" Us still exchanged it for a new one. We are still very happy with this product.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"My friend had one that my son loved to watch and play with at two so when my daughter came along the durable, entertaining seat won us over.  Fisher Price is almost always a sure bet and a bouncy seat is used all over the house, keeping little ones in place and amused.  My only problem is my son still loves to play with it and I will likely need to invest in Duracel!  Batteries, batteries, batteries!No faults in my book.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I love this bouncer.  My son took awhile to notice the fish in front of him but boy when he did he went crazy.  He loves it.  It's how I take a shower, eat dinner, etc.  My only complaint is the toys come down so low they touch his legs and bother him.  I took off the linkadoos and now all is well.  I would buy this one again.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"Our daughter started using this bouncer at about 2 months. First, she just stared at the fish and listened to the music. Gradually, she has begun playing with the swinging parts and she can make it work on the ""baby"" setting. Still, we have another bouncer that has hanging objects but no music and it seems to give her more active, thinking exploration than this bouncer.",4,1
Fisher-Price Open Top Take-Along Swing,"This is a great swing - simple to assemble, easy to operate and store.  My twins love them!  Although we have plenty of room, it's nice that they compact for out of the way storage.  I'm not really sure about the other reviews, but both swings work at all speeds without any noises!  We were so happy to find a simple swing without timers, music, etc.  Besides, babies don't spend many years in them so we didn't think it was necessary to buy complicated, expensive contraptions! :)",5,1
Safety 1st Perfect Fit Gate,"True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5""-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor.My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes.My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one.",5,1
Safety 1st Perfect Fit Gate,"Wow.  Who would've thought you could get everything you needed at such great quality at such a low price?  Our little one just started scooting across the room rapidly, so we figured it was time to get a gate to keep him out of the kitchen.  I had a coupon from Babies R Us for 10% off baby gates (priced $25 or more), so we went in and took a look at the selection, which was pretty good, actually.  Gates ranged in price from around $20 - over $70, which seems like a wide range.  We were hoping to stay at the low end, so we ruled out several right away.  I was worried about the toeholds on the diamond or square metal mesh of the really cheap gates in case our baby turns out to be a climber.  But the things that we saw in the more expensive gates (solid panel, ability to swing on a hinge, etc.) were all in this gate!  Not to mention the fact that you could also use it without the hinge, and it had the ability to be used on uneven door frames.  We had the intention of putting it up on a hinge because of the inconvenience of taking it out and putting it back all the time, but tried it without and discovered it's so easy, we don't even really NEED to mount it to the doorframe!  For anybody worried about the strength of unmounted gates, I honestly wasn't expecting it to hold so firmly!  You put it in and expand it to fit the opening tightly, then push down on the handle to lock in place, which  tightens it even further.  All these pros and I can see no cons so far!  With the coupon (we received in the mail, I think because we made a baby registry at our local store before our son was born), we got the gate for less than $30, including tax.

Safety 1st Perfect Fit Gate,"I bought this gate as a means to keep my child in her room, or in the upstairs area, on occasion.  It is exactly what I needed.  It is very easy to install and take down, and it even will create a tight fit if one side of the wall has high molding.  (If you have high molding on both sides of the wall, it will not be tight.)  The pads on either side are high enough, though, that they fit above most standard baseboard moldings.  It is light enough to carry fairly easily, so I can transport it well, and may even take it along when we visit my parents, because it is so easy to set up.  It is not the best choice if you want to leave it pressure mounted permanently because you would have to take it down or step over it ever time you wanted to get around it- there are many better gates with openings for that.  I cannot say how well it works when hardware mounted, as I have not used it this way, though again, I would think that there would be better gates for a permanent mount.  But for a temporary, portable gate, it is an excellent choice.",4,1

Fisher-Price 900 MHZ Long-Range Monitor with Dual Receivers,"We've had a great experience with this monitor.Pros:1.  The sound quality is crystal clear.  It is extremely sensitive with no static at all.2.  The range is good- I can use it outside in the garden without a sacrifice in quality.  The belt clip is helpful for such times.3.  The light readout is far more helpful than I had anticipated.  It indicates the intensity of the sound on the other end with the number of lights.  This is useful because if you routinely adjust the volume on the receiver as I do, it's hard to objectively assess what's going on in the other room based purely on the sound level.  Also the visual feedback is useful for when you're doing something noisy that doesn't lend itself to wearing the receiver in vibrate mode-in my case that means showering or running on the treadmill.Con:1.  The monitor does eat batteries (as most of them do).  We generally leave it plugged in during overnights and just use the batteries when we carry the monitor during daytime naps.2.  After 6 months, the vibrate mode doesn't work as well as it once did.  I don't use it much anyway, so this isn't much of a problem for me.I would definitely recommend this product.  As with all monitors, however, keep your receipt until you've tried it out at home.  Every location has its own issues with interference and a unit that works great in one place may be less effective for you.",5,1
Koko - 6Pc. Bedding Set,"What can I say???  I am totally pleased with this gorgeous set!  The material is wonderful, so soft and thick!  Absolutely worth every penny!  I would have paid $300 for it!!!",5,1
Koko - 6Pc. Bedding Set,"Very feminime and soft NOT overly bright and tacky. I love this collection, it is perfect for our sweet little girl. The butterfly and vine accents/ print our so serene and tastful. I'm a very happy mommy and even daddy loves it!",5,1
Learning Curve Lamaze - Spike the Dinosaur,"This is our son's favorite toy.  We hang it on his activity blanket, the swing and car seat.  He absolutely loves it.  He loves to hold it in his hand and try to reach for it when it is hanging from somewhere.  There are a bunch of different rings and sounds that keep him occuppied.  He just lights up when he sees it!",5,1

My Friend Emily,"I bought this doll for my daughter when she was about 3 months old, she is now five months and has always loved this doll. She especially likes the crinkle sound the dress makes. I attach it to her infant carrier every time we go somewhere and people are always asking me where they can get one. It's a must have for every little girl.",5,1
Evenflo Whisper Connect Nursery Monitor,"We bought this monitor back in '05 for the birth of our first daughter.  It picked up every little sound she made and I could even hear her breathing.  I love the lights, so you can actually have the monitor turned to no sound, but still see the lights.  Rechargeable and holds a very long charge.  I just plugged it in all night (on) and was able to use it about the house all the next day.  Wonderful.  It has finally died on us after 2.5 years.  We have dropped this so many times, down the stairs, on concrete and everywhere else!  We will be purchasing a new one just like it!  Oh...I agree, those other reviews are for different models...there is no animal alarm on it.  Great monitor...highly recommended!",5,1
Red/Black Jeep Wrangler Twin Umbrella Stroller,"This is a great stroller!  I have a 4 year old and 18 month old. They both love to ride it in (although the 4 year old is starting to prefer walking).  It fits through all door ways, turns corners SO easily and folds up so small.  It doesn't have storage but the middle handle is great for holding shopping bags and/or diaper bags.  We mostly use it for occasions that I know the 4 year old will get tired of walking or needs to be ""contained!""  But when we go with just one child or are going somewhere the 4 yr old can defintely walk, we take the Jeep Urban Terrain stroller (3 wheel w/front wheel being a swivel) - another GREAT investment!",5,1
Boppy Pregnancy Wedge with Cotton Slipcover,"This pregnancy wedge is probably the best purchase I've made thus far in terms of keeping myself comfortable (and happy) during my pregnancy.  Unfortunately, I made the decision to purchase one way too late.  I only got mine last week when I was 36 weeks pregnant(!!), but if I had bought one sooner, I would have saved myself many sleepless, uncomfortable nights and naps.Like other people, I had been skeptical about buying an $18 wedge for my pregnant belly when I already had a body pillow and several other pillows to provide support.  It didn't seem practical, but as the weeks wore on during my third trimester, it became abundantly clear that pillows either don't give enough support and faltered beneath the weight of my belly, or were too firm and lifted my tummy uncomfortably to the point where it seemed that my baby was being smashed back on to me.This Boppy wedge provides the perfect amount of support, and adjusting it is simply a matter of bringing it further or closer to you.  Another great thing about it is that it is not overly large, so it isn't cumbersome to sleep with.  I completely forget that it's there after I've gotten myself comfortable with it!  In addition, it doesn't absorb your body heat like other pillows do, so it never gets uncomfortably warm.Finally, you might wondering what you're going to do with it after you give birth to your baby.  Well, the pillow can be used as a back support or a wedge to place between your knees while you're sleeping to preserve hip alignment.  And if you don't want to use it for these other things, then just keep it in storage for your next pregnancy!I'm actually so incredibly sold on this product that I plan on purchasing them for other first-time pregnant women as baby shower gifts.This is a good investment for your and your baby's comfort, and your sanity as well!",5,1
Boppy Pregnancy Wedge with Cotton Slipcover,"I'm now 36 weeks into my pregnancy and have been using this wedge since about my 27th week. Before I broke down and bought the Boppy wedge, I absolutely could NOT get comfortable sleeping on my left side, as all the pregnancy books/sites/experts tell you you're supposed to do. No matter how many regular pillows, folded or wadded-up blankets or towels I tried to jam in around me, I just couldn't get comfortable enough to spend more than maybe an hour on my left side.From the very first night with the Boppy wedge, I was able to get comfortable almost immediately on my left side and stay that way for several hours -- usually at least until I had to get up to visit the bathroom. I'm not saying I can stay on my left all night now -- I don't think it's possible or healthy to spend all night in one position, at least not for me. But this wedge definitely made a huge difference.Cons of this item are so insignificant to me that they didn't merit giving it four stars instead of five; the only recurring issue I have with it is that when you take the cover off to wash it, it's a teensy bit of a pain to get it back on correctly. The wedge itself has gotten slightly flatter with use, but it is definitely not flat enough to reduce its effectiveness in the least, and I am not a small woman (even when I'm not pregnant!).Lastly, unlike some of the other pregnancy pillows/supports out there (I'm also going to review the Snoogle, which did absolutely nothing for me), this one takes up hardly any extra bed space, is easy to ""adjust"" to your comfort requirements, and is easy to move around if you want to switch it from one side to the other.Bottom line: Don't wait till you're at your wits' end, like I did, to buy this wedge! Get it early and use it often. Boppy wedge: $14.99. Getting comfortable enough during pregnancy to achieve restful sleep: PRICELESS!",5,1
"Boppy Cuddle Pillow with Cotton Slipcover, Sage Circles","I love my Cuddle Pillow!  I got mine in my 3rd month and haven't slept without it ever since, even taking it on two trips (comes with a handy case).  I've used it from both ends, starting out with the smaller end between my thighs/knees, and now have the smaller end up at my chest (helps keep the ""girls"" apart and has eliminated my need to sleep with a support bra - at least so far - I'm at 29 weeks).  It doesn't take up the whole bed, and makes turning over easier than one of those huge things - plus my husband still has room enough for him.  The zipped cover is washable and I don't have any trouble getting the pillow back inside.  Sure, it can get a little mushy, but I just refluff to distribute.  (Try the air setting on your dryer too.) ** My baby came a month early, and I'm still using the pillow.  I had it with me at the hospital, and two nurses commented on how neat it was.  My lactation consultant also approves of it - I use it while nursing, and my husband uses it when he feeds the baby a bottle.  I've even let my son briefly nap on it (while attended).  BEST purchase throughout pregnancy and nursing!",5,1
Infantino Shop and Play,"I too had problems with this fitting different sized carts, but Infantino customer service said they are improving the size and making it fit better.

Evenflo Exersaucer Smartsteps Jump &amp; Go,Before buying a jumper we tried the jumperoo at the store...my baby hated it. It was so bulky that my baby couldn't do anything but cry. when she tried this jumper her eyes lit up and started jumping like it was second nature. She absolutely loves the toy in the front as well. She uses it when she is not jumping. I absolutely recommend this.,5,1
Evenflo Exersaucer Smartsteps Jump &amp; Go,"We really like this for our 7-mont-old son.  We actually are borrowing it from a friend, whose daughter is 5 months older than our son.  When our guy was 5 months old, we tried him in it.  He didn't mind it, he just sat in it and spun around, playing with the toys on it.  He didn't quite ""get it"".  After about 4-5 times of putting him in it, he understood the objective: to jump like crazy!  Now, at 7 months, he will jump in that thing for up to an hour! When he's bored and fussy, all we have to do is put him in his Jump-and-Go, and he is ecstatic for a good long time!The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is hard to find a spot to hang it, since we have a fairly open house, with our family room really having no door frames. We got creative and figured something out, but only because dad is very handy!",4,1

The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,My son loves this versus the little individual potty he sits on. It makes potty time more real to him because he gets to sit on the toilet like a big boy! It fits perfectly on the seat.,5,1
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,This seat is much better than the Dora seat we had previously (and donated to our daycare so our daughter would go there as well).  The Dora seat seemed to get dirty easily between the cushion and the handle piece and it had a &#34;splash guard&#34; that made getting on and off or having them bed over to wipe a pain - sometime literally.  This seat is great and has none of the issues we noted with our previous seat.,5,1
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,"My 24 month old daughter loves this potty seat.  I bought it for her last month, and as soon as she saw it, she wanted to start using it right away!  She now goes pee-pee on it everyday (we're still working on poo-poo).  The only negative to this potty seat is that it's not made for elongated seats, which we have in both of our bathrooms, so it tends to slide alittle (it doesn't seem to bother my daughter, though).  I wish that would have been stated in the product description because I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I known it wasn't going to be a perfect fit.  I would have returned it and exchanged it for a different one that's made for elongated seats if my daughter didn't love it so much.",4,1
Baby Einstein Discovering Water Play Gym,"Santa brought this for our 2 1/2 month old and she has loved it since we took it out of the bag.  In the beginning she loved just staring in the mirror and seeing the lights.  Now that she's 5 1/2 months old she loves batting at/tugging on the toys, talking to the baby in the mirror, and babbling along with the music.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun gym for their little one.",4,1
Arm's Reach Mini Co-sleeper 100% Cotton Natural Sheet,"Discovered my granddaughter had not been able to find these fitted sheets in here locality so I went to my Baby's R Us and they were kind enough to order them for me.  I received them very quickly and it was a very good thing because within a day or two I was on a plane to go see my brand new very first great grand child, Mykah Rose.  Her mom was still in the hospital when I arrived so we were able to get the co-sleeper sheets to her house and set up before she brought the baby home.  Out of habit, I washed them before using them and was very, very impressed with the quality.",5,1
Arms Reach Original Co-Sleeper Sheet: Natural,These are soft and fit great.  I had heard that ordering co-sleeper sheets from another source doesn't always work out.....they aren't as soft and don't always fit well.  I liked this so much that I ordered another one later.  I knew from my older daughter's experience when she had her twin boys 5 years ago that you shouldn't dry these in the dryer so I air dried them.  They are great and I recommend them.,5,1
Medela New Pump in Style Original Breast Pump,"I read a lot about the breast pumps and I knew that the medela was the best on the market, but it was so expensive! We didn't have all the extra money to spend on a breast pump, so I started looking on Craigslist to buy one second hand. I found a woman selling this exact model, for $65, and she had used it for about 4 years. I bought it, as well as new tubing, bottles, shields, pretty much just got the AC adapter and the unit from her for the $65 and everything else, brand new, ran me about $45. So, after waiting till everything new can in, I tested out the pump and it worked great! I was able to sit, pump, and be done in about 20-30 minutes! I was so stoked that this wonderful pump was working so well after so long, and only cost me about $110!! I love this pump!",5,1
Medela New Pump in Style Original Breast Pump,"My daughter was born in Sept of 2004, and a friend bought me the Medlea Pump In Style knowing I would have to return to work before the end of last year. It was the best thing anyone bought me for the baby. I had trouble in the beginning getting her to latch properly, so the pump really helped get my supply back up after our initial difficulty. Once I returned to work in December, I pumped 3 times a day to collect milk for her to take to the sitter's. After she was six months old, I found I could reduce my efforts to pumping just twice a day at work, and still get enough milk for her. I just think that it is wonderful to have something that has kept her breastfeeding all this time.I will say I wish it had come with instructions on how to use it though. It had instructions on how to assemble it, but no tips on how to actually use the darned thing. I was having such trouble in the beginning, that I had to hire a lactation consultant at a cost of $125 an hour to come help me figure out both regular nursing and also how to pump effectively. Now it's no problem for me to figure out how to adjust the controls to maximize my production, but as a first time mom, I had no idea how to be effcient with this pump until the consultant watched me and gave me tips.Since my pump was purchased last fall, it doesn't have the bottle strap, picture holder, or removeable cold case. It's still a great pump. I kind of wish the insulator liner was removeable as it can be difficult to keep clean. Overall though, this is a great product. Oh and the battery pack is great too. Several times I forgot the power adapter at home and had to use the battery pack at the office. It lasted a really long time (twice a day for over a month) and when the batteries went dead it all just sort of got slow. Certainly is great for working mothers who want to continue giving their baby the best food around.",5,1
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Active Carrier - Black,"A previous review mentioned that dreaded word ""RECALL"" when referring to this product.  It should be noted that this warning was misinformed.  With a little extra research (""Consumer Reports"" is one of the best and most objective sources for such information) one can discover that the recall in question was only related to products manufactured before 1998.  I've attached a copy of the report for anyone interested in considering safety without the detraction of misinformation:""Recall Notice:  Baby Bjorn soft-fabric infant carrierBaby could slip through leg opening and fall out.Products: 240,000 infant front carriers sold 1/91-10/98 at juvenile specialty stores and by catalog for $75. Carrier came in navy blue, black, denim, green, and other colors. ""Baby Bjorn"" is printed on front and on strap. Straps fit over shoulders and around torso of adult; baby faces adult's chest.What to do: Do not use carrier for children less than 2 months old. Call 877 242-5676 toll-free for kit to reduce size of leg openings. Carriers currently sold aren't being recalled.""Hope that helps!",5,1
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Active Carrier - Black,I had a cheaper carrier for my first child and it was horrible...My lower back would hurt after five minutes of carrying her.  This time I spent the money for the Bjorn with the lower back support and I can carry my baby around all day with out any pain.  Well worth the investment!,5,1
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Active Carrier - Black,"I bought this carrier in August of 2004 and I love it.  My daughter is now six months old and we still use it all the time.  It is really comfortable to wear.  The best part is that it can be worn by my 130 lb frame or my husbands 220 lb frame with no additional straps needed like the regular bjorn requires.  When the product was recalled the company notified me by email and sent me an expense paid UPS envelope to return the straps that were recalled.  No hassle at all.  I am very please we bought this carrier and I recommend it highly!  When I was looking to buy a carrier I wasn't sure if this one was worth the extra money, but it definitely is !",5,1
Combi Deluxe Activity Rocker,"This is the best bouncer I have ever owned. It is very plush and comfy-cozy. The colors are very soothing which is the point when you put the baby down for a nap. The toys come off, so you can buy others if they're too boring. The vibration is great, the rocker is not automatic, but its still great. I love the 5 pt harness.  I have a 5 and 2 year old that think the baby is a toy and want to carry him.  They are not able to unstrap him. The seat reclines back for a new born so their head and neck isn't all twisted.  THE SEAT COVER DOES COME OFF IF YOU NEED TO WASH IT. It tells you how in the instructions. It's very easy to take off and put on.  It washes very well too, just follow the washing directions.  I highly recomend this bouncer it's well worth the money. I know that babies r us has discontinued it in their stores but you can still purchase it on-line.  And if you're lucky enough to find one in the store, grab it, it's probably on clearance.  The employees can tell you what stores have some left.",5,1
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,"We found that this product is definitely worth for the money. However, we also found that it is lacking some features.1) Removing and installing again is not that straight forward.2) It acts more like a barrier than a gate.",4,1
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,This gate does what it says it does...its minorly annoying to take up and down every night and stepping over it can be a little tough. But overall I am happy with it.,4,1
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,My husband and I bought this for our very wide living room entrance to keep our little explorer from going into the dining room.  We shied away from the other gates that you have to drill into the wall or woodwork for you can't fill in wood trim once you have no more use for the gate.  My baby loves this gate and it keeps her out of trouble.  It is short enough so that it is easy to step over so it really never comes down.  I give it 5 stars for being so sturdy and safe which is always a top priority for parents!,5,1
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,"Easy to assemble.  Works great on wide, uneven spaces/doorways.  I use it to block off the kitchen to keep my puppy in while I'm away.  She jumps and pushes it all the time and the gate never budges.  If you prefer gates with no hardware, I recommend this as an option.  It doesn't leave marks on the walls, either.  Great buy.",5,1

Basic Comfort Ultimate Crib Sheet - Green Dot,These sheet protectors or crib sheets if used alone are nice.  They protect the mattress or regular crib sheet below and are easy to remove and put back on.  You don't have to wrestle the crib mattress to change it when wet in the middle of the night.  I would not put them in the dryer for fear of shrinkage and caution when hanging them... they drip making a good puddle.,5,1
Peg Perego Aria Twin MT Stroller 2005,"I don't think there is a ""perfect"" double stroller out there for $300.  There are single strollers that cost way more than this one and those are not perfect either.  So I'm giving it 4 stars because it can be improved by the maker.  The child trays are small.  The sun shades are small.  But I have one of those single canopy sunshade and it works great with this stroller since it's not too wide.  The stickers for the word ""Aria"" were coming off but I put it back and it seemed to stay.  Other than that, the size is perfect.  My 2 year old and 6 months old daughters are very happy riding in this stroller.  Some peoople said the weight differences could throw it off balance and might cause it hard to turn or move around. But I don't find that is a problem.  It's light and very easy to move around.  Both trays does swing open individually from the middle out.  It has separate seat reclining which is perfect.  The closing and opening are very easy to use. I have a Prius and this stroller does fit in the trunk.  Overall, this is a great tandem stroller.  My girls prefer sitting next to each other rather than one sits in the front and the other sits in the back.  As for the price differences because of the colors, I don't understant that at all.  I prefer the black one and it's cheaper.",4,1
Peg Perego Aria Twin MT Stroller 2005,"I love this stroller for running errands. I use the stroller for a 15 month old and 4 month old and it's great for both. There is a tray for holding snacks for my older baby. The seat lies flat for the younger baby.  The stroller is easy to open and fold. It is super lightweight. The cup holder is small but works well for limited uses. The basket is pretty good too. This is a great stroller for using on a daily basis. It steers great, even with one hand. I don't think it would be the best stroller for using some place like Disney World because the basket is somewhat flimsy and the sun shades are a little skimpy but for something that is easy to haul in & out of your car and running in and out of places it's a great stroller.",4,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White",I bought this for a little lift at the head of my bed and two of them are doing the job.,4,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","Our son had reflux, so he slept in a Rock and Play rocker bed for the first 6 months.  When we tried to transfer him to the pack and play or crib, he just screamed and cried and did not sleep more than 30 minutes at a time (with protest!).  Since he was able to sit up and his legs were starting to hang out the end of the Rock and Play, we had to do something!We bought this wedge (which came in one piece unlike some of the other reviews) and put it under the mattress on the pack and play.  We then took two rolled up towels and put them under the sheets on either side of our son.  This recreated the feel of the Rock and Play and he slept in it the first time we tried!  We also let him play in the pack and play for the few days before the wedge arrived - hoping to create a positive feeling about the thing before having him sleep in it.I know we're lucky he slept in it right away, but without the wedge and the towels, he would not sleep in it!  So, it worked for us.  Also, he is now 7 months (two weeks sleeping with the wedge in the pack and play) and he does not slide off the wedge.  Not to the side or the bottom.  We will slowly start to remove the towels (use smaller ones...) and then eventually remove the wedge.  But for now, it works great.A note: If you are expecting this wedge to be high enough for the recommended reflux elevation, it isn't!  It is fairly subtle in terms of lift.  So, if your child is still dealing with reflux and needs a significant incline, read the details so you know what you're getting.",5,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","The reviews listed here are for two different products: one is the product here, a one-piece crib wedge by Dex for $15-ish, the second being the foldable crib wedge also by Dex for $30-ish.

Hope this clears up any confusion for other parents researching crib wedges.",5,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","I like this universal crib wedge - I use it when my son gets a cold, since he's too young yet for a pillow but could use some propping up when his nose is plugged.  I find that it's easier to actually put the wedge under the mattress instead of under the sheet - it stays put better and I don't have to worry about my son feeling the zipper on it.  The wedge stays in place nicely and is the perfect width for our standard-sized crib.  So much easier to use than trying to prop the mattress at an angle with books!",4,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","We first got one of these to help with reflux. It worked wonderfully! With our next newborn, we were told to use this for the baby to sleep on when congested. Works like a charm.Not sure what another poster was talking about with a zipper.

Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Farm Animal Mobile (Styles May Vary),"Love this mobile. This would keep her occupied for hours if I left her there to look at it. Her eyes light up when I turn it on.  She gets so excited kicking and cooing away.This is not a ""sleepy"" mobile. It's full of bright colors and cool designs. The way the mobile is slanted is brilliant. She focuses on each animal as it comes near her. I totally buy the black and white idea too after having this mobile.

Even though we took down the mobile portion, it is nice that we can still use the music box in his crib to entertain him.",5,1
Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Farm Animal Mobile (Styles May Vary),"This is hands-down the best thing we bought for our fussy baby. It was one of the only things that would calm him down, and give me a chance to shower or do anything that didn't involve holding him. He is now 2 years old, and sitll has the music box part attached to his bed, and still plays it as soon as he wakes up. Our second son will be born next month, and we plan to get the same mobile for him.  [...]",5,1
Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Farm Animal Mobile (Styles May Vary),"This mobile isn't the loveliest to the adult eye, but my newborn adores it.  When nothing else works to entertain her, she will watch and listen to this.  In fact, some of her first gurgling and cooing was to this mobile.  And it gives her parents a 15-minute break to shower, answer email, or eat!  We love it.",5,1
Evercare Pet Lint Pic-up Refill,"Just as good as original product! super sticky, pull off easily. Works incredibly for fur. I would recommend for all roller needs.",5,1
Vintage Teaberry 4 Piece Crib Set,"I bought this in a Houston BRU.  The colors are sweet, rather than babyish.  The fabrics are decorator quality.  The skirt and blanket are crushed velvet sage green (leaning towards olive)and so soft.  The gorgeous vintage bumper is in a decorator weight woven cotton.  The pink eyelet trim on the bumper is so sweet, it is not a washed out pale pink but a richer pink with some possible apricot watermelon undertones.  The sheets are sweet and simple in a creme color with pink stripes.  I can't wait to see/ buy the mobile, it is to be released soon (March 1st maybe)!",5,1
Vintage Teaberry 4 Piece Crib Set,"I've read some of the reviews that said that the quality was poor, but I went to the store to see for myself and I have to disagree.  They had this collection displayed on the floor and I was very impressed with the quality.  The fabrics were very soft and I really liked the idea that the bumpers were all slipcovered individually.  That was a really nice quality detail.  I recommend checking the bedding out for yourself before making a decision, but I would highly recommend this set to my friends.",5,1
Simply Shabby Chic Jolie Lace Quilt - Full/Queen,you just never know when you purchase on the internet - but the quality was very good I felt.  I was pleased with the online description and the take home reality.  We love it and in fact became our main spread when it was purchased for a guest set!,5,1
The First Years Disney Pooh Deluxe Sunshade,"This is a very cute little shade and it seems to stick to the window very securely with the three suction cups.  The only downside I've noticed is that it is too small for my Subaru Outback so it only blocks the sun about 50% of the time.  I've moved it to several different positions thinking that maybe I had it in the wrong spot, but it really is just too small.  It does make quite a clatter when I shut the car door.Giving it four stars for how noisy it is when I close the car door -- the fact that it is too small isn't the fault of the product, it's the fault of my huge car. :)",4,1
Expedition Jogging Stroller,"A jogging stroller is not at all meant to be used in place of a traditional stroller, or to fit in the trunk of cars. The front wheel doesn't turn on purpose!It definitely serves it's purpose as a good, overall jogging stroller. I purchased an, almost, identical model that Baby Trend made for The Right Start. The difference is that it does not have the pockets, etc. and is black and grey. I was initially unsure of how much use it would get, and didn't want to spend $300 on a Dreamer or BOB to only find out that my son hated to run. To my surprise it has preformed great for me, and my husband too. The 16"" wheels work well on the beach, and the treads are nice for any type of terrain. I don't have the indoor storage space, so I keep mine outside, underneath a covered awning with a plastic sheet over it. The fabric still looks brand new despite this!I run 3-6 miles on a mixture of pavement, gravel and grass, and have experienced no problems in more than a year of regular usage. My son has been riding in this since he was 4 months and really loves it. To him, he's going out on a walk while Mommy gets to workout. I added a Snuzzler for his comfort, and the only time he fusses if he's really sleepy and Mom runs over anything bumpy - so it must absorb shock well. The parent cup holder isn't very deep, so a water bottle will probably need to be stored underneath. The other little area on the parent tray has been a great place for me to tuck my IPod into.This stroller really helped me to get back into my pre-baby jeans, and didn't empty out my pockets! It's an excellent first jogger, a great buy if you can't afford a professional model, or want to be sure that running with baby in tow is for you. I absolutely would buy a double when it's time.",4,1
Metalica Pliko P3 MT Stroller,This is a great stroller I would give it 5 stars but it is missing a few things that would make it an absolute dream. Here is what I love:1)Unlike some other reviews I find it easy to fold and unfold. One handed? No. but easy to use.2)Small and compact when not in use. It fits in the back of my car and leaves lots of room for shopping bags etc.3)Great visor. I love that it can completely cover the baby. When my daughter was 6 weeks I was caught in a flash rainstorm with her in the mountains and I just pulled that down and the carseat carrier up and she stayed completely dry. It also is great to keep wind and sun out. I also love the little window so you can see in to see if they are sleeping etc.4)Easy secure in and out for the car seat latch system.5)Seems comfortable for her.6) Unlike some other reviews I find the storage bag to be plenty big.7) Easy to recline the seat8)Looks great. I have the red.Now the negatives (which are pretty minor overall)1) I find it a little difficult to steer. I am getting used to it but in the beginning I would be shopping and bump into racks etc.2)The drink holder could be bigger it doesnt hold a bottle of water or even a small drink. Plus it pops off half the time in the trunk and it is easy to misplace or forget to bring with you.Minor really. I think its great though and give it 4 stars.,4,1
Trendsport Lite Stroller,"Yes, there are some faults with the stroller, but based on the price, it is still probably the best bang for the buck.  We got this stroller because I needed something that I can carry up and down the stairs while I am on the subway.  Most people in NYC are helpful, but every once in a while, I have to do it myself.  I would not know how I would do it without my Trendsport.My husband bought the Graco MetroLite, which was 18 lbs, so I complained that I needed something lighter.  The Trendsport was perfect, since we did not have to shell out a lot of money.  Sure, there are some problems trying to steer it, and there are only 2 seat-positions, but these are very minor drawbacks.  It is still a great stroller and definitely a great bargain.",4,1
Sir Leapsalot 5 Piece Crib Set,"I am a huge fan of frogs and couldn't believe it when I found this set.  The problem with some of the other frog sets I have found is that there are frogs everywhere!!  I love the subtlety of this collection.  The colors and fabrics blend so beautifully together and they're aren't frogs everywhere...but they are in all the right places.  If you love frogs, this set is for you.",5,1
Sir Leapsalot 5 Piece Crib Set,I had a difficult time trying to find a nursery theme for my boy/girl twins until I found the Wendy Bellissimo set at Babies R US.  This past weekend I put the whole set together in their nursery and it looks BEAUTIFUL! The colors are just perfect for either a boy/girl nursery and the froggies are adorable.  5 stars to Wendy Bellissimo!,5,1
Sir Leapsalot 5 Piece Crib Set,"I ordered the Sirleapsalot set as soon as I found out I was having a girl.  Although the set may look like the chenille is blue on the screen, the description clearly states that it is lavender.  I ordered the 5-piece set, lamp, diaper stacker and valance.  I was very pleased when it arrived.  The blanket and crib sheet are super soft.  The bumpers are made of a heavier fabric that will stand up to a baby pulling on them and going through the washing machine.  I really like the fact that the bumper slipcovers zip off of the inner pillow for washing.  The stitching and embroidery seems to be of good quality.  Also, the lamp was larger than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.  The set is great for a girl without being too frilly.  All things considered, I am glad I made this purchase.",4,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"We have a GE XL44 gas stove. Installation was all often seconds. We have a ""crawler"" not yet ""toddler"".So far, he can just reach the knobs and can't get enoughleverage from that angle to do anything. For us it'spretty easy to open and close the covers to use theburners.",4,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,Those covers are a very good design and easy to handle and install.  The material is pretty strong plastic and they open up to the front for you to turn on the stove.  I would recommend those covers to everybody with a gas stove and kids.,5,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"We love these, and we've been using them for about 3 years now.  I just came back to buy a set for my friend, who has a hellion of a 2 year old who has defeated every child-proofing device out there, but he hasn't defeated my stove covers!  He has pulled the whole knob off INSIDE the Safety 1st cover before, but he still can't turn the gas on, and he figured out that there was nothing too exciting underneath it anyway and gave up quickly!  I don't know why anyone would want to keep their knobs in a drawer, and if your range is anything like mine, taking the knobs off would create a hazard on its own, leaving sharp little eye-poking things sticking straight out from the front of your range!Ours are plenty heat-resistant, by the way.  We have an old gas range that heats up the whole house every time we use it, and these are still going strong after 3+ years.  They do get warm to the touch when the oven is on, but it's certainly not hot enough to burn anybody, and they don't melt.",5,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"So I didn't buy them because I have a kid, but I bought them because Im a renter and I noticed that the markings on the knobs of the stove would come off easily when I try to scrub off splattered oil or food from daily cooking. I use these covers and they prevent all the gunk from building up saving me from having a potential issue with the landlord. Yey! I know its a weird use, but hey, a little bit spent here will save a headache later, and I can easily take them out for the next apartment I rent!",5,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,They are very useful easy to install except they are a bit of large size that you can't fix all  of them on five knobs as they are touching each other.,4,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"These covers look decent on the stove and do the job. This is the second set I've had, the first set lasted a few years.",4,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"These covers have been a blessing for us with our grandchild (almost 4) who is now in our custody. He is being tested for autism, and he is a handful! We feel much more at ease when he is in the kitchen, even though he is being supervised. He can spin the covers, but he can't get at the controls at the moment. We hope he doesn't figure out how they open for a long time...at least until we can get a new stove with controls out of his reach. :)",5,1
Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,These were easy to install and work great to keep my 1 year old from turning on our gas stove!,5,1

Kalencom Potette Disposable Liners - On The Go Potty Liner Re-Fills,I would recommend this to any family potty training or traveling.  We've even used it at the park when the toilets were closed.  We always have ours in the trunk for emergencies.  Fairly compact & quite sturdy.  Even my tall DD didn't have a problem using it in a pinch.,5,1
Kalencom Potette Disposable Liners - On The Go Potty Liner Re-Fills,"I liked how easy these were to put on (yep should have put them on after taking the used one off, but we always seemed to be in a cold windy spot so it was done in the car).  We used these for traveling and they worked great.  Some said I could use grocery bags, but all my bags seem to have small holes in the bottom.",5,1
"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue",I bought this for my little girl who was potty training and we were going on a trip to North Dakota.  It was wonderful!  I highly recommend this product.  She felt comfortable sitting on it and it comes with it's on bag and we just keep it in the van.  Perfect!,5,1
"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue","This portable potty chair is great, and we used it a lot for our potty trained 2 year old.  It was helpful in our vehicle on long trips, and also hiking up in the mountains (it is very small and easily fits in a back pack).  I keep it in our vehicle for those times there just isn't a bathroom close by.  Instead of buying extra liners, I make my own: I cut diapers up into pieces (about 4 inches square), and set each piece in a grocery bag that does not have any holes. You can have several liners prepared and stacked on the potty chair at once, so when you use the top one, tie it up and dispose of it, the other one is already in there.",5,1
KidCo Finger Guard - Gray - 2 Pk,This product is just what I was looking for. They are very durable and easy to take on and off. My daughter's door tends to slam shut and lock with the windows open. This is a perfect solution! During the day I put it on the inner hinge side and it keeps it open. At night I put it on the knob side and close the door almost all the way but know it won't shut. I recommend this product and plan to buy another pair for our double doors in the den.,5,1
Bright Starts Soothing Safari Mobile,i liked it very much and my baby too. she loved it looking on it when lieing in her bed.,5,1
Columbia Baby Backpack With Ripstop Trim,We looked at the Eddie Bauer and a couple others and are really glad we got this one.  They put thought into how to make it into a diaper backpack and not just a backpack.We love it and highly recomend it to anyone looking for a diaper backpark.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,We just spent a few days at Disneyland and this container was great for bringing snacks with us.  We were able to use the divider and put 2 different kinds of puffs + 1 kind of yogurt drops.  Worked perfectly.  Lid stays on.  Sturdy (our little guy threw it multiple times). Great container!  Could also be used for just 1 kind of puffs.  Fill it up!,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,"The good?* It's inexpensive* It's very sturdy* The lid stays closed/locked* The formula doesn't mix with other compartments* You can fit a lot of formula in each section (at least 6oz, I haven't tried 8oz yet)* The cup will be good for snacks when formula is doneThe bad?* It takes a bit of tamping and shaking to get all the formula out (and even then you might still miss some--but it's not usually that big of an amount to worry about)* It's a bit bulky.",4,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,"I love this....I am not sure about cramming 9 ounces of powder mix into each section, as enough powder to make 6 ounce bottles seemed to fill it up without packing it down tight.  I love the fact that it becomes a snack travel container later on.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Reservoirs Replacement, 2 Pack",I ordered these because my dishwasher tends to mangle bottle pieces on occasion. This was a great value (especially through Amazon Mom). They fit perfectly with both my old and new Dr. Brown bottles.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",Good brush for Dr. Brown bottles. Price is great considering the brushes don't last a long time.  I would recommend this product.,4,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",These are easily misplaced and it seems that replacememts are better than the cleaning brushes that come with the bottles.  I'm glad I made the purchase.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These brushes are useful in cleaning those narrow and long tubes that come with Dr. Brown's bottles. Those blue color tubes, if you know what I mean.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","Now I can clean my reuseable straws with ease!!  I use to feel they weren't as clean as they should be just putting them in the dishwasher.  Now I can be sure they are clean!!  Just wish they were longer.,",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",Perfect for cleaning bottles or straws. stiff enough to get the job done yet flexible to move around the product,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I bought these brushes to help keep a syringe, that you cannot use soap on, clean and clear. Our cat needs a twice a day syringe-full of meds that are sticky beyond belief. I run hot water for awhile and then use the brush that best fit the tube and have been very well pleased. It's been in use for a number of weeks now so I guess it will hold up well in the long run too.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These little brushes are fantastic! We used them for the Dr. Brown's bottles and then kept on using them for sippy cups and especially the straws for straw cups. They fit inside perfectly and clean out all the gunk in case you forget to rinse them immediately. They hold up pretty well, too. We have only just started using  a second one and the first one lasted for at least 8 months. We always propped it up with the cleaning part at the top in a little cup so it would dry completely, and we washed it regularly with soap and water. I think these are a little smaller than some of the other cleaning brushes, so you do need them for the Dr. Brown bottles (The bottles come with a couple, so don't buy these until you need more).",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I bought these to clean the sippy cup straws for my kids and also my straws for reusable plastic tumblers.  They work great for both.  I chose these because they were the best price and came in a pack of four.  They work great and seem as durable as I can expect this kind of thing to be.  I'm sure I'll have to replace them at some point like I do with all of my dishwashing brushes, but I think they are a great product for the money.  They are a little short if you are trying to clean very long straws, but I find them sufficient for the straw of my 22oz. tumbler.  I like that these to not have a fancy plastic handle because that means they cannot break off of their handle the way I have read that others do.  I highly recommend these for keeping reusable straws clean.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I was looking for a perfect brush for cleaning the straws of the water bottles, straw cups of my toddler. Finally I found one. They are just perfect and appropriately priced.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",These long handled brushes are great for cleaning the Dr. Brown's bottle parts as well as sippy cup lids and valves.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",These are cheeper than buying the ones for a Podee and they work just as well.  I really liked them.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",I ordered Dr. Browns Cleaning Brush at the same time I order my reusable straws. I love using the polycarbonate straws but had a hard time keeping them clean. Dr. Browns little cleaning brush does the trick.  I keep one hooked to my dish drainer and I am able to clean the inside of my straws every time I use them.  I gave one of the cleaning brushes to my daughter so she could clean the straw on my grandson's sippy cup..no more crusty straws.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack","I used to use Medela brand caps on my Dr. Browns bottles when sending them to daycare (the daycare kept the other parts such as nipple so i just transfered the bottles back and forth), and they would leak. I then bought these caps and they dont allow the bottles to leak.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",These are perfect. Seals the Dr. Browns bottles tight so that there's no leakage. Great for travel or storing expressed milk.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",LOVE-these work great with the evenflo glass bottles-fits both the 4 oz and the 8 oz. Works so much better than the nipples and covers or the 2 piece caps.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack","Universal sizing makes these excellent for my bottles. They work as expected. Easy to clean, easy to put on and off, durable (so far)... etc.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",These caps are great for making and shaking formula in Dr. Brown's standard bottles. They don't leak and hold up great in the dishwasher. These are a must for Dr. Brown's bottle owners!,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",I didn't like using the caps with the rings because they always leaked.  These fit perfectly on my glass Evenflo bottles.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack","These work great with the regular and the glass standard sized Dr. Browns bottles. We used these to store pre-made formula in each day and when traveling , not a single leak, no stains, and they never broke.",5,1

"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",I love them. Tops are easy to close and they do not let bottles to lick. I prefer them to the caps from medela.,5,1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I read a lot of reviews before buying this diaper-wipes warmer, and I'm glad I did. I actually bought a different brand first, then read horrible reviews about it and returned it without even testing it. On the strength of the reviews here, I bought this wipes warmer, and have never regretted it. It keeps the wipes warm, moist, and comfy. Our baby loves it, and it makes changing her diaper much easier when she is mellow and happy.If you have a very cold house, this warmer might not be warm enough, but it's still bound to be better for your baby than room temperature wipes. My baby was born in early April when it was still snowing, so this wipe warmer was a lifesaver. Now that it's June, it's not as necessary, but we still use it and our baby still prefers warm wipes to cold.The window that lets you see how many wipes are left gets condensation and fogs up, so you can't really see how many wipes are left (also wipes are white against a white background, so it's hard to see regardless), but I am still giving the product 5 stars, because it is rare that something so affordable will bring so much happiness to your newborn baby!",5,1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"We returned the Lionheart warmer and got this instead. This one works MUCH better. It actually keeps the wipes warm and is easy to use. The light can be handy although we dont use it much. Its also easy to see if you are running low on the wipes rather than get suprised when you pull out the last one. If you need a wipe warmer, this is the one to buy.",4,1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I got laughed at for purchasing this item. Yep, I am ""one of those Moms"", but I have to say it was one of the best purchases. When my son was born he HATED getting his diaper changed. The minute I used the warm wipes, it was a whole new ball game. No more complaints, no more fussiness. In fact, just the opposite, he loves his changing table. He is now 3 months old and still laughs the minute I place him on the changing table. He can now use cold or warm wipes, but I continue to use the warmer because I love it so much. And I am sure he will too come winter!",5,1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"This product is NOT a waste at all....You just have to read the directions! IT says right in the booklet that after you put the wipes in the warmer you have to add a 1/2 a cup of water  over the top of the wipes and turn on the light and wait for it to warm the wipes. (If you put the water at the bottom of the machine and turn it on then the top wipes dry out and the bottom wipes are saturated). The wipes do cool however a few seconds after pulling it out of the machine..but then again how long are you planning to hold the wipe in your hand? Pull out the wipe and wipe the baby's tushy and throw the wipe away and pull out a new one. Make sure that you close the top of the machine when you are not using the warmer to keep the most recent wipe warm and moist. Register for the item, if you like it then great, if you don't you don't lose anything....",5,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","My daughter is breast fed mostly and trying to get her to take a bottle was next to impossible. She would gag and end up throwing up most of what she did manage to get down. These bottles are great for breast fed babies. We used Dr. Brown's at first and she still took in so much air she would cry from the gas pains. As soon as we switched to the Playtex bottles, she drank from them with such relaxation and didn't have any gas after. I got rid of all my other bottles and use ONLY the Playtex drop-ins.",5,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count",This bottle system is wonderful.

Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go.",4,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count",Playtex is always been my favorite! I love using it coz it' durable. I ordered this for my friend who's giving birth soon and  it's also in her wish list so I bet she loves this product too!,4,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","After hours of research online, this was the bottle with the brown latex nipple (purchased separately) that other moms recommended when trying to add bottle to breastfeeding.  My little got to about 3 months of age when she realized breast was her favorite and NOTHING else would do as a substitute.  She refused to take any other bottles and my breastmilk supply was dwindling and she was starving!  Those were a rough couple of days. They did not carry these in stock at stores and Amazon.com had the fastest shipping.  I also purchased a 3 pack of the Playtex Drop-ins Nurser bottles and a box of liners.After she got used to feedings from these bottles we were able to switch back and forth between these and other bottles that we supplemented with in the beginning like the Tommee Tippees.At 6 months now she still prefers these soft latex nipples and of course morning breastfeedings.These bottles come with the clear nipples pictured.  Many moms such as myself find that if the baby won't take this nipple when switching back and forth between breast and bottle, they will take the Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow.",5,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","I am a full-time working mom who also nurses.  I used these bottles with my first child for 13 months (from the day I went back to work until he was weened), have started using them with my second child. Both took them right away and I have never had a problem with the bottles, nipples, or drop-ins.  I like the clean, sanitary drop-in liner for each bottle.  The slow-flow nipples are a good shape, texture, and flow for breastfed babies.  Neither of my babies had any gas problems with these bottles and there aren't millions of parts to wash like the bottles designed to ""reduce"" gassiness.  I have washed the nipples in the dishwasher MANY times with the high temperature wash and drying cycle and not a single one has clogged or torn.  I DID, however, have that problem with the Avent nipples. I store my milk in 4-ounce increments.  I can easily fit 8-ounces in the 8 ounce drop-in.  Perhaps the person who was only able to fit 7 ounces had the drop-in crumpled up?  I highly recommend these bottles.  I found them to be excellent quality and affordable.",5,1

"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","Even when I bring a bottle brush in the diaper bag I cant always get to a sink. Thats where these come in. They really help make cleaning bottles easier and convienent. Although it is an added expense with the liners, they are pretty inexpensive in bulk and if you dont use them all day everyday. Would reccomend to a mom who doesnt have much time to clean bottles or who wants an inexpensive easily replacable (they sell these pratically everywhere,even gas stations) quality product.",5,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","My daughter is two months old and I just discovered these great bottles. I was a die-hard Avent user. I used them with my older daughter, now 7, and used them with my baby born in March. While the Avent system is good, I love the presterilized drop-in disposable liners. Now I have minimal clean up and I only have to sterilize the nipples, rings and tops!!! This is such a great find. I have completely replaced all of our Avent bottles with the Playtex Nursers. The drop-in refills are very inexpensive and are more than worth the money in the time it saves.",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),Having seen what few uses of pacifier can do to a newborn - cause 'nipple confusion' (if your baby refuses her only source of nutrition - imagine emergency declared) and leave parents feel helpless and wonder what happened to the angelic baby who fed so well at the hospital. I am glad that there is a bottle that makes the baby's switch from breast to bottle and vice versa convenient. The bottle is easy to clean too with opening from at the bottom of the bottle too.,5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),I have nothing to complain about these bottles. I had avent before but the nipple were so tough and leaked. Playtex is easy to wash and good design for holding. My baby also seemed to be happier with those instead of other brands.,5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"I wish I had found these bottles sooner, it would have saved me a lot of money and trouble.  My twins have never been able to nurse effectively, so I have had a long ten months of pumping and experimenting with different bottles.  We have tried half a dozen other bottles, including Dr. Browns.  Dr Browns worked well in eliminating gas, but washing and cleaning the bottles were a headache.  Out of the box I knew these bottles were special because they were so easy to initially clean and sterilize.  Once I figured out how to assemble the bottles (it wasn't difficult) I tried them out on the twins.  Both of the babies immediately had no trouble switching from the Dr. Brown bottles to the Playtex, even though the nipple base is considerably larger.  Both babies burped easily after drinking their milk, but they didn't spit up (as they usually do)  In the week or so since the first use they still have not had any major problems spitting up, or being extra gassy.  Also, cleaning these bottles is a dream compared to the Dr. Brown bottles.  I do have to agree with the other poster who mentioned that you need to be extra diligent in cleaning the ""threads"" of the bottles, as they can yucky if you are not careful.  Overall, I wish I had found these bottles sooner, because they have made feeding (and clean-up) easier for me, which is important since I am working ""double time"" with twins.",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"So, I have a 4 day old daughter, and due to medical reasons, we have to supplement with formula. We have triedTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Newborn Starter Set, but their ""slow flow"" nipples flow at the speed of Niagara falls compared to how these flow. These work a million times better as the flow actually works at the speed my daughter needs. Other ones would cause milk to spill out the side of her mouth, and allows her to take so quickly she projectile spits up because her little stomach can't handle it.Anyways, these are perfect for my newborn, not sure how she will grow with them, but she will definitely be using these for the meantime.",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"This is a really nice and handy little set of bottles.  I love the size, it is perfect for a newborn to 6 month old baby, and even can be used later for juice or water.  The design of these bottles is amazing and I love that it cuts down on gas for the baby.  And of course BPA free is a must.  This would make a lovely baby shower gift as well because what new mom couldn't use extra bottles?",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"These bottles are great value for money and they are true to their claim - less/no spit up, colic and and gas as the air in the bottles is vented out so that it does not become a part of the feeding routine.  I recommend them highly to anyone who might be searching for good bottles -particularly first time mothers.",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"We started using Drop Ins Nursers when our baby was about 6 weeks old. Drop Ins worked well and really helped on colic but it was not very convenient as you need to push the air out before feeding and because my hand couldn't reach all the way, I had to use some kind of &#34;tool&#34; (like a milk collection bottle/ long tube etc) to push the air out. This is inconvenient especially when you are out and about - and if you forgot your &#34;tool&#34; then you will not be able to push all the air out. Also I had to keep the bottle in overturned position whenever my baby paused during feeding in order to prevent air from getting back into the liner (and then have to push the air out again) so this is very messy as milk will continue to come out from the teat in overturned position.So I switched to VentAire and I just love it! It doesn't give my baby any gas, reduce spit ups and it is so much easier to use. No more buying liners, pushing air out, keeping bottle overturned. There are more parts to wash but they are so easy to wash. I have used them for a month and only encountered 2 leaks because of human error. If you assemble them properly, they will not leak. I also picked the Wide version in order to reuse the teats from Drop In Nursers. I definitely recommend these bottles.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"We received this swing as a gift.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It is wonderful.  We kid that it's the cadallac of swings.  My daughter really enjoys the fish that go in a circle.  She is mezmerized.  The swing offers so many nice options such as swinging 2 different directions, music, ocean sounds, extras can be on or off, etc.  It's just wonderful.  The batteries hold out a long time, too.  Of course, the heavier the baby gets, the more batteries you'll use, but you won't mind.  You can't go wrong with this swing!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing is great!  My daughter is 4 months old, and we are still going strong with it!  It was all she would sleep in at first and she still loves to nap in it.  The fish are the first thing she really focused on too!  She would watch them go round and round!!!  She still looks at them, but now mostly just enjoys the swinging.  I like the side-to-side and the front and back swinging option too.  The only complaint I have is that it takes up a lot of room, but I guess most swings do!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"At first I was a little hesitant about choosing this swing.  I knew it would sit in our living room, and I wasn't a big fan of the ""baby"" look (bright blue, etc.)  I liked how the papysan blended in with our decor, and I liked the jungle plaid's price, but I ended up choosing this swing because it was so highly recommended.  I am SO thrilled with my choice!  The colors don't bother me at all, and our baby LOVES to look up at the lights and fish.  We get so many compliments on this being the ""cutest"" swing.  I also love the cradle swing function -- when she is fussy and all else fails, we put her in and it lulls her to sleep.  Definitely a great swing!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I used this swing through two kids, and it's still in great shape! Both were fascinated by the mobile, as well as the lighted dome. The older one liked the ocean sounds, while the younger one preferred the music. The older one was a colicky little demon for about three months, and oftentimes this was the only way to get and keep him to sleep.The drawbacks (and they're slight):1. This thing is REALLY a battery hog, especially if you run the mobile, light and/or music. Stock up on Ds right now!2. They seem to outgrow this a little faster than other swings, maybe because of the relatively shallow seat that makes it so comfortable early on. Even with the tray on and the belt secured, both almost tipped over the edge soon after they could sit up. Both were out of it by the time they were six months old. I guess you could argue that if they can do that, they don't belong in a swing anyway, but it would have been nice to have the ""easy"" way of getting them to nap last a little longer.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I thought this swing was really cute before my boys were born, but was even more taken by it after they were born prematurely. Preemies needs motion in more than just forward and backward, and this allowed them to get this motion without me carrying them all of the time. I loved that it moves both side to side and forward and backward. They LOVE the lights, music, and mobile. It is completely adjustable to sit up straight or lay down depending on the age of your baby. Also, it has a toy bar on the front it you would like to attach anything to it for the baby to reach. We haven't had any mechanical problems with this swing and the seat cover washes well in my washer. Overall, spectacular!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,Got this as a gift from my sister when her son was done with it.  It is now ofically 5 years old and still works great.  My boys still use it and it is just a good today was the day that I got it.,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"Nothing wrong with it, good design, kid loves it.  I just wish it had an optional power cord so we don't buy so many batteries.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I LOVE THIS SWING.  MY MOTHER GOT IT FOR ME AT A GARAGE SALE ALMOST COMPLETELY NEW.  MY DAUGHTER LOVES BEING IN IT.  THERE IS ONLY ONE ""CON"" IN MY OPINION.  IT GOES THROUGH BATTERIES WAY TOO QUICK.  THE SWING TAKES 4 D BATTERIES AND I HAVE TO REPLACE THEM EVERY MONTH.  OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS A GREAT SWING.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My son is almost seven weeks old and he LOVES this swing. We put him in it from the time we got home from the hospital.  He enjoys swinging, but mostly he gets a kick out of the fish on the mobile.  He will just stare and watch them go around.  This is wonderful until it automatically shuts off and he begins to SCREAM.  So as I try to do a few things around the house I need to hit the reset button every 7 minutes if he is still awake.  Sometimes, if he has fallen asleep, the lack of noise when the mobile and/or music stops wakes him.  The other drawback with this swing is how it sucks up batteries in no time.  Granted we use the swing a lot and will often run the mobile and music together, we go through a pack of batteries every other week which is expensive.  If there was a way to plug the swing in, I'd be psyched.  Like I said, the swing is great but definatley has some drawbacks which we are dealing with.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"We bought this when our baby was only 7 weeks old.  It has been the most wonderful thing we have purchased yet. It has lights, music, toys and more.  It has 2 different swing positions also. It keeps him busy and puts him to sleep.  If you need time for yourself...a definate must!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! JUST LOVE IT!  FIRST TIME MOM LIFE SAVER. BEST MONEY SPENT.  I GOT IT WHEN GIANNA WAS ONE MONTH. SHE LOVED IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I GOT HER IN IT AND SEVEN MONTHS LATER SHE STILL DOES.,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My husband and I bought this for our nephew when he was 7 weeks old and he loves it! It was amazing to see him zero in and focus on the fish swirling about in the mobile and the bright happy colors of the fabric side panel. He was completely entranced!My brother and hubby said it was fairly easy to assemble, though none of these things is really easy. I think they got it done in about 20 minutes.It has a relatively large footprint. When using the swing in the back-to-front swing direction, the right leg tends to lift slightly off the floor (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I don't think there's any way it could tip or be unstable. I haven't seen it used in the side-to-side cradle mode yet. I do think the large footprint adds to the stability.After seeing how much my nephew (and his parents) enjoy this swing, my husband and I changed our registry from the Papasan swing to this one. Less money and more features? Yeah, that's the way to go!",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing is an absolute lifesaver and it was worth every penny I spent on it. From the moment we brought our son home from the hospital he has enjoyed this swing. We keep it in the side to side motion mode (though you can choose front to back as well) and he will literally stay happy and occupied for hours--this includes the time he spends sleeping in the swing. When he turned about 6 weeks old, he really started to enjoy the lights, sounds and circling fish. Now at 8 weeks, he talks ""at"" the fish all the time! It is fun to watch, and on a more economic point, for as much as we use the swing, it does not seem to drain the batteries as much as we thought it might.Honestly, as a brand new mother, if there is one baby product that I could not live without, it would be this swing.Be forewarned, it does take up a lot of space, but if you can make the room, it is worth the sacrifice.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My son had colic for his first month.  Some nights the only way he went back to sleep was in his swing.  He loved the sideways motion, the ocean waves, and the lighted mobile.  We would have been lost without the swing.  He out grew it after 5 months, and it still looks like brand new.  It with stood our black lab bumping it, and our two year old niece tugging and pushing.  I would recommend this swing, but buy a lot of d batteries.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing has been a lifesaver on many occasions. My son is 6 weeks, and I have been using this since a couple of weeks after he came home. I use it so that it swings front to back not side to side (he doesn't seem to like the side to side motion). He doesn't mind the speed of the lowest setting and he likes the music. He is beginning to focus on the fish and the light dome now. It does take up a lot of room when set up, but it does have a high clearance, so you can put some stuff under it. I use it almost every day for at least a couple of hours and the batteries are still the original ones I put in. The motor is kind of loud, but not bad. It's worth it to have something that he loves so much, and gives me a little bit of peace! It's especially great when he is colicky. The rocking motion really calms him down. I wanted the papasan swing from fisher price originally, but there were some complaints that the motor was catching on fire, so I decided on this one. I am really glad I did.Update: At almost 6 months, my son still loves this swing. It goes through batteries like crazy now, so I do use rechargeable (regular alkaline might last longer on a set, but trust me, once they hit a certain size, you'll still be replacing them every couple of weeks at least). Now that he can really see the fish, he gets unhappy when they stop turning, and sometimes the music is the only thing that will make him sleep. I still am glad that I made this purchase!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,This product is wonderful. My son is 7 weeks old and is just starting to see the things around him so the fish around him catch his eye. He can be entertained with this for hours or at least until he falls asleep and then I can sleep too! This is so wonderful and I would recomend this to any new parent.,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I am your greatest reviewer - I am what you could call a repeat customer.  I had the first generation cradle swing about 4 years ago, before the Aquarium came out with all the bells and whistles.  My first son is now 5 years old, and he slept in his swing all night for about 5 months.  That's the only way I got any sleep.  Now my twin boys are 18 months, and we bought 2 Aquarium cradle swings.  It's the same phenomenon.  I'm telling you, every good thing people say about these swings is true.  THEY ARE LIFESAVERS!!  Even when we dared to travel, these swings came with us.  We just took off the seats - it's one simple screw and nut - we folded them up and loaded them in the Excursion.  It was all we needed to take.  TRUST ME IF YOU TRUST NO ONE ELSE.  I've had 3 of these swings - first my son in '99, and then the twins.  We have just gone to porta cribs for naps and sleeping, so we're done.  But God bless the Aquarium cradle swing.  There is nothing better.  I know - I've lived it.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My sister-in-law recommended this swing to me and I am glad that I listened to her!!!!!I highly recommend the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing for all new mothers!!!!  My daughter who is now 3 months old spends many hours a day in her swing, she loves to look up at the lights and the fish and she loves the music too!!!  I let my daughter fall asleep in the swing every night before I put her in her bassinette.  This is the best gift that I could have ever gotten, my dauther is very content in the swing!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing was great.  When my boy was a newborn, he loved the wave sounds and rain water.  As he got older, he preferred the music.  We used the cradle swing initially and switched to the forward/backward swing as he got older (> 6 months).  He has recenty outgrown it but we plan to keep it for our next child.  He LOVED the lights and mobile as well.Only complaint was that the batteries wore out fast and the swing never sat perfect level (always seemed lean slightly to one side).",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,We love the Fisher Price Aquarium swing!!!We originally bought the Baby Papsan swing but after looking at the Aquarium swing we decided to save ourselves the $40 and get this one instead. And I am very very pleased with it. The lights are so cute and the fish and lights and sounds are much more baby like than the Papsan. The Papsan is more aestheticallypleasing but I think the Aquarium swing it more fun for baby!! And that's what counts. She looooves it! We have bought may other Aquarium products and are very pleased with them as well!,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"There has been enough accolades for this product and i agree with all of them, babies demand attention and this swing does a great job of calming our son down, he loves it.The downside is that it requires you to buy recharable batteries and a charger to keep it cost effective, batteries last 3-4 days on full charge with 5-6 hours of use per day, there is no electricity outlet.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"To all new Moms and Dads: Get one of these before anything else!I'm a new mom and my newborn just loves it!!! We got it when he was two weeks old, and he can get enough of it. He's now 2 month old, and this incredible thing will give you all that extra time you need to do things around the house, cook, clean, pluck your eyebrows, get pretty....anything!! He'll nap for hours on his swing.I recommended it 100%!!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing is absolutely AMAZING!!!  My husband and I had a plain swing we borrowed from someone.  It was fine.  No bells or whistles.  However, shortly after our baby was born, someone gave us their used aquarium swing...wow!!  What a difference.  It swings side-to-side or front-to-back.  It gives you the option of no music, music, or a variety of soothing sounds.  It has a mobile that can be on or off with a light that also can be on or off.  Lots of options with this.  Our daughter loves it still and she is now 8 months old.  The fish on the mobile easily got her attention from the start.  She doesn't use it as much as she once did, but she still enjoys it.  As someone else mentioned, the batteries last a long time for all that they have to operate.  As she's gotten heavier, we've had to replace them a little more frequently, but not much.The only con to this swing is the amount of space it takes up, but I would not trade it for any other swing.  It is just awesome.  You can't go wrong with this one!!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I cringed buying this for my second child, especially since my oldest never liked her swing and it was a waste...but my husband had to have it since it matched our theme for the baby.  I wish I had bought this swing when I had my first kid!It was hands-down the best purchase we could have made.  The cradle position is wonderful for newborns, since the regular swinging motion scares them because they feel like they are falling each time it goes backwards.As a military family traveling, it has been very convenient because the way the swing is suspended from above & makes it easy to use as a temporary high/feeding chair.  Plus, it's lightweight and comes apart with ease.  It's even easy to bring over a friends house.Unlike many swings for about $20-30 cheaper...this swing has a mobile that MOVES AUTOMATICALLY so keeps their interest longer.  Plus, you can have the mobile move independant of the swing motion.  And the lights and water in between the mobile is awesome.  My son loves it.  Well worth the extra money!!I have a lot of friends with babies, and their swings are NOISY.  This one does have a mechanical swing sound like every other on the market, but this one is more quiet.  I would say this one has more of a ""hum"" than a ""clank"" sound...which helps ease a colicy baby.After 3 months of FREQUENT use (by frequent, I mean after work...so cannot compare to that of a stay-at-home parent), I am still on my first set of batteries.  You can't go wrong with this swing!!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing was a lifesaver for our household!The swing can be turned to rock forward & back,or side to side; so if the baby gets restless,you can offer them a completly different view with the push of a button.The little globe on top changes color as it turns,which proved to be facinating to my son.My son was born with severe acid reflux,and was unable to lay completly flat,especially after eating,so this swing also served as a cradle/bassinet for the first few months of his life.We both slept much sounder due to the aqurium swing and the soothing water sounds it makes(as sound as you can sleep with a newborn.)Although there is a slight mechanical sound as well,its not too bad.Last,I do recall that when we first got home,the swing seemed to go a little fast for an infant-we simply layed a rolled up recieving blanket over the blue swinging arm to weigh it down a bit,and it was perfect!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"Our baby loves this swing...If he gets bored of going front-to-back swinging, he enjoys going side-to-side.  He loves to watch the fish and listen to the music.  I would NOT buy any other swing! STOCK UP ON BATTERIES THOUGH!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I am the mom of a 1 month old boy and when we brought him home from the hospital he wouldn't sleep in anything longer then 15 minutes.  He didn't like to lie on his back and he hated having to much space (I think it made him nervous) We tried a bassinet, a pack and play and a numerous amounts of different baby chairs and swings but the only time he would sleep for a good amount of time was when we held him. When he was a week old me and my husband decided to buy this swing hoping he would sit in it awhile so I could at least make dinner or do laundry. The first time we put him in it he LOVED it, he loved looking at the fish mobile and listening to the music and after being in it awhile he fell asleep and slept for over 2 hours!  Ever since that day my son has slept in it every single night and for most of his naps during the day.  The ONE downfall was that even on the lowest setting the swing was still a little fast for a newborn but we just hung a blanket over the side and it was fine. Definatly not a big deal.  So to any mom who has a baby who won't sleep anywhere but being held I suggest they try this swing! You WON'T be disappointed!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I actually purchased this item for my stepdaughter.  She was having difficulty finding this locally.  She has a daycare and needed it for her little one. I suggested to her to let me check your website.  I ordered it and in only a few days she received it.  She was very pleased  with the swing - its quality and colors, not to mention the discounted price.Thanks so much.  Sharon Minnich",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,Our daughter would not nap unless she was in this swing.  She loved it.  You do have to be sure a blanket is not dragging on the ground as that does slow it down.  We used it with her for months.  We just had a newborn and pulled it out for him.  It is still working and he loves it as well - the music setting is what we use and it really calms him down.  I didn't notice our daughter ever really noticing the fish part of it.  Maybe because she went to sleep so fast when she was in it!  :)  A definite must have!,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"When we first brought our son home from the hospital, he hated the swing we had bought and refused to nap at all during the day no matter how much rocking/singing/nursing we could give him. I think the regular swings made him sit too far up and he didn't have the head control to stay comfortable. A friend bought this swing for us since it was the one the hospital had in their nursery. He absolutely loved it and had his early morning nap in it from about 2 months til now, when he almost outgrown it. It held him more at an incline to support his little head and the side to side motion seemed to be more soothing than front to back rocking. It will be sad to pack this swing away.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,has amazon gone crazy? Who would buy this item for 300 bucks when it's available for 100 or less dollars else where...,4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....Although this was a good swing with different swinging and music/lights options, my son didn't love being in the swing. Quality seems great, mine seems like its still brand new. Will hopefully get more use out of it with baby #2.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My daughter just turned a month old and at first we didn't set the swing up because a lot of reviewers said it goes too fast for a newborn. We set it up a week ago and it's been a lifesaver for us! Its one of the few ways we can get her to calm down. The swing is very cute and easy to use. You can do a combinaton of music/sounds and features- mobile on and water globe off, water globe on and mobile off, music on or off, and the music has a volume switch.The one downside is that it drains batteries pretty fast. I wish it had an adapter to it that plugs in. Fisher Price has great customer service though, we received the swing in August and after a week of use for some reason our mobile stopped working. I called them up today and after explaining the problem the operator said a new moter unit is being shipped out to me today! He also told us that if we have any more issues feel free to call back since the swing is under warrenty and they want their customers to be satisfied.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"We used this for our first baby, mostly in the cradle position and she loved it.  The lights and music were a huge hit.  It is a little hard to get the baby in and out (she was very big), but once I got used to the canopy, I stopped hitting her head!  We also liked that you can take off the activity tray, it was more in the way than anything.  I wish it plugged in, but the batteries life was surprisingly long.  We'll be using it for number 2 in a few weeks.",4,1
Clippasafe Ltd Cot Cat Net,Very good product Super great quality I never bought anything better It's worth the money Would highly recommend it !,5,1
Starlight Blue Sky Chenille Changing Pad Cover,"I don't know how it will fare after a few washings, but it is very soft and comfy for a baby and matches the set very well.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"Priceless. I keep this on my nightstand to add an extra pumping session and relieve midnight engorgement. Doing so has boosted my supply and made me less stressed about pumping enough during my work hours. It takes me about 20 minutes (I do it when I get up for a midnight potty break) and I get anywhere from 6-9 oz total. It's very easy to use and doesn't wear your hand out. It's also super quiet. Since I added nighttime manual pumping to my routine, I consistently come out ahead in the milk usage/storage department.I'd recommend it for anyone who is struggling with producing enough or needs a quiet and less cumbersome way to relieve nighttime engorgement.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"This pump works great. I use it at home when I need to do a quick pump. I also have the Medela in Style for work, but don't always want to set that all up at home. This was money well spent. Works quickly and easily.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I have to pump due to latching issues, and even though I have the Medela double electric pump in style, I often use this manual pump because it works so well for me. I feel like I get milk out faster with the manual pump because I can manipulate my breast better and also switch up the speed of the pumping as I please. I carry this in my diaper bag so I can pump in the car (while hubby drives) because I can get out a good 4 oz in 10 minutes whereas with the electric, I have to wait like 20 minutes and that's pumping both sides at the same time! I have also found its a great way to get rid of those clogged ducts that can come on after frequent pumping. If it weren't for the possibility of carpel tunnel syndrome, I would exclusively use this instead of the Pump in Style.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this pump to take on vacation while away from my baby so I could pump but not have to go back to the hotel room every 3 hours. It was excellent!! I even used it on the long flights sitting right in my seat next to strangers. I had my nursing cover for privacy, and the pump makes no noise so they had no idea I was even pumping. :) I would recommend this to traveling moms or just when baby doesn't completely empty to relieve fullness. The only thing that would nice would be to offer different sized shields.",4,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,i like the madela so much that it's very comfortable and i can make with a 3.5 oz in 30 minutes,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"My husband bought this pump for me so I could sustain my milk while we were traveling. I was afraid I would dry up while being away from our baby. This pump is awesome! Great for traveling: relatively small, easy to put together and take apart, easy to clean and easy to use.I made the mistake the first couple of times of pumping constantly which was a bit taxing on my hand and wrist. Then I figured out you don't have to do all that and that once your milk comes in, you can just have one continuous pump which extracts quite a bit of milk before you have to make the pumping motion again (if you're not sure what I mean, just read the directions and you'll get it.) It will save your hand and wrist a lot of trouble!I strongly recommend this for moms that aren't able to use an electric pump. I have both but when I'm on the go, this pump is perfect.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I ordered this pump for my third child after my electric pump quit working for my first two children.  I use it once a week or so for an occasional bottle for my daughter and it works great.  I can't express much milk from it, but she is a snacker, so I'm not sure I would get much more from an electric.  It's very comfortable and super easy to clean.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,Really easy to use!  Perfect to take when traveling! Serves its purpose one breast at a time. It's a great product.,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this pump to use in the morning when I have a lot of milk and only feed the baby on one side and pump the other.  It works great.  I also have the big Medela Pump in Style pump but haven't event used it since I got this one.  It's great for once in a while pumping and gets just as much milk out.  It doesn't take much time to set up like the big pump and you don't have to mess with all the tubing.  Cleanup is easy, too.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,very nice mannual pump worked great. i love the fact that Dr. Brown's bottles can attach to the pump perfectly. i'm using it every day and it's powerful. it doesn't need too much of space as the electronic pump.,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"When my milk first came in, I was in so much pain from over-full boobs. I knew I had to find a good pump to get some relief but I didn't want to buy an expensive one as I would not need a high-tech pump, just one to get the job done quicker than hand-expression at the time. This pump is a life-saver!! I used an Avent Isis hand pump and it was downright awful- the suction was terrible and it hurt like crap on top of already sore boobs! The Medela Harmony pump worked very well and still does a month later!",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I was given this pump from a family member during my 3rd pregnancy, I'd never used a manual pump before and can't believe how much I LoVe this one!I did buy a bigger breast shield for it and have found this to be helpful, I have had a lot if problems with the electric pump I bought and am going to try using just this manual pump when I return to work in 3 weeks.  If I decide to buy another electric pump it will definitely be the pump in style.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,I used it through out my nursing period for my second child. The best part is I dont have to depend on battery or electricity while using this and also the sound it makes is much lower than the battery operated one or the electric one.I loved it. Only that I needed to replace it atleast 3times and the cost was a killer.,4,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"First of all I live in India. The pumps you get in medical stores look like bicycle horns, and the good ones==there's very little choice (I've seen a philips Avent, a Pigeon, and a Farlin, which are among the good ones, but I've only seen single models of each of these brands without much choice in stores). I just wanted to be sure, so after reading rave reviews for this particular one, I decided to go for it.I did not plan to pump too much because I work from my home office, but I have an oversupply and manually expressing milk to relieve the pressure was way too time consuming. I didn't want to end up with blocked ducts mastitis and all the other problems that come with oversupply. Before this pump arrived I was already battling a clogged pore.If you have a good supply of milk (evidenced by the fact that y our baby is satisfied after feeds, not by the amount you can hand express), then you will be able to pump enough with this manual pump. I used to manually express into a graduated bottle to see how much I could produce, and I would get 2 oz a side after say 20 minutes each and a lot of pressing and pain. With the Medela Harmony I am able to produce 4 oz from one side within about 10 minutes, no pain, no need to struggle. I don't even push the pump all the way.Pros:-This manual pump is good if you are an SAHM, pump to relieve oversupply, or pump infrequently for other reasons.-It comes with an extra bottle, lid, nipple, stand, and cap.-The two pumping strengths simulate the initial suckling to sitmulate letdown and the slower, longer suckling motions of babies.-The suction is pretty strong but it can be minimized if the handle is pushed down only part way.-It comes with an instruction manual.Cons:-The apparatus looks daunting at first with little parts here and there, but it's easy to get the hang of after a single dismantle/reassembly.-The pumping mechanism is directly connected to the bottle and flange, etc., so they come in direct contact with each other. This means everytime you need to use it, it needs to be sterilized/sanitized.-There is a tiny white &#34;washer&#34;-like ring that attaches the pump to the rest of the assembly. This came off while I was sterilizing my Harmony the second time after I bought it. Luckily I noticed it, figured out where it goes and popped it back on. Without this washer the suction refused to work. So watch out for the tiny parts.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I purchased this pump as a travel pump for occasional use while away from my baby. I have the Medela single electric also but it is too loud to use discreetly in public. This pump is easy to put together and super compact. I carry it in my purse without a problem, snap it together within a few seconds, and can pump 3 or 4 ounces in less than 15 minutes! I have trouble with letdown when pumping and the 2-phase expression really helps me to get more milk. I've actually had more success with this than the Medela Lactina I rented. Also, the shield on this pump is a bit softer which makes it super comfortable! Definitely worth the money for an occassional pumper like me!!",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"This is a fantastic manual pump, especially for the price! I have the Ameda Purely Yours and I actually find myself using this more now. I do still love my Ameda, but this is so quick & easy to use and clean. Believe it or not, I can actually get more milk in less time than with my dual electric. It's perfect for my middle of the night pumping session and travels easily. I can't recommend this enough. I might even buy one more to have an extra for travel etc. Great product!",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,I have the electric pump but it need me to stay at 1 corner to pump. Having this manual pump helps me a lot. It also has ergonomic design which allow me to pump without hurting my hands. I had 1 manual pump from ameda (which is given free by the hospital) and this is MUCH BETTER!,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"This is truly a wonderful breast pump.  I have used Medela's ""Pump in Style"", but I prefer this for its convenience and ease at using.  I am a stay-at=home mom and my need for a breast pump is very limited.  The only problem (and it is only a small problem)I have with this product is that it is not marketed for retail purchase.  I needed it immediately and searched many Medela retailers for it.  Finally I ordered it online.  I would have loved to have purchased it from one of the many stores I visited and called and saved the postage.",4,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I love this pump! My daughter didnt latch on right away and I used this pump since day 1! She still doesn't latch on and now she is 6m and still breastfed. I use this pump EVERY DAY! Easy to clean, easy to use, your hand won't get tired like many women think, (only if you pump for an hour, then maybe) I get good suction with this pump! Always pumping 4-7oz in literally 20mins or less from both breasts! I pump at work too, so it is easy to carry, no noise, easy set up and takes little space! I loveeeee this pump! It comes with everything described and it is all handy! Trust me! All extras will be useful someday when pumping everyday!",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,This item meets the basic expectation. Only we found it's still take a lot of work to pump the milk. We finally decided to go to the automatic one to save the labor.,4,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I like it.it was shipped very quickly.This is what I want, if there is a good offer I will choose to buy other products.thank you!",5,1
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"I just purchased a marathon for my 4 month old son who is just too heavy for his snugride. I got this seat a couple of days ago and could not believe how quick and easy it was to install. I was a little worried it would be too big rear-facing, we have an X-Terra, but it fit perfectly behind the drivers seat and I didn't even have to move the seat forward to make it fit. My 2 year old daughter has the Eddie Bauer 3-in-1 Elite and it was a total nightmare to install rear-facing and would only fit in the middle seating position. I wish I had never bought it for that and many other reasons! I just ordered the Ashley Floral pattern for my daughter and can't wait to use it. For the safety, ease of install, and total convenience, you can't beat the value of Britax.",5,1
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"We bought this car seat after originally buying a Graco that was later recalled. Although it was pricey it's been worth every dime. My son is three years old now and is tall for his age but he still fits perfectly into this seat. It's easy to clean and is a breeze to install. In fact, if you have the LATCH system this car seat takes less than a minute to install. We bought the Britax Companion for our new little one because it was the safest one on the market at the time but at 6 months old it's already too small for her! We're going to get another Marathon for her and will install it rear-facing for now and after she's 20lbs/1yr old will turn around.",5,1
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"I researched so many car seats before finally buying this one.My daughter hates sitting in the car seat, but when she does, I know I want her to be as safe as she can possibly be, and the Britax makes that possible.It's a nice seat, somewhat big in my tiny little Nissan Sentra, at first I wasn't sure if it would fit, but it does.Sometimes one of the straps kind of gets twisted, and it's a pain to fix, but that doesn't happen often. And when I go to buckle my daughter in, I have to put the right buckle in first, and then the left, otherwise it doesn't buckle in completely, and will come open.",5,1
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","We love this car seat, in fact, its our second marathon carseat.  The wife loves the cow pattern, our other is a standard gray color.  Our child outgrew her infant car seat so we moved to the convertible, she is much more comfortable in it and we will be able to use it for the next couple of years, unless she grows too fast.  Easy to install if you have the latch system, installs in minutes.  It is rather large, but it fits into a smallish A4 backseat, granted the front seat is almost as far up as it can be.  No regrets with this purchase.",5,1
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","My son HATED his infant carseat carrier when he was little.  When he was six months old, we got him a Marathon, and the screaming in the car ended instantly.  He's still sitting in that seat, and he still loves it.  When his little sister arrived, we thought he might want to graduate to a booster seat, but he didn't want to give up his Marathon, so we bought a second one (Cowmooflage) for the new baby. Now I have TWO Marathons in my back seat- one facing forward with a 40-lb five year old, one rear-facing with a 7-lb one week old infant.  The baby is equally content riding in her seat, and I sure don't miss lugging the ""baby bucket"" around.The only word of caution I'd offer if using this seat for a newborn is to cover the velcro on the harness straps (used to hold the straps out of the way while placing the child in the seat) with a little piece of fleece or something, to keep the rough ""hook"" side of the velcro from scratching the baby's delicate skin when her hands fall into her lap while riding in the seat.  I also added an infant head support.  Works great, and we know from experience that we'll get years of enjoyment and peace-of-mind from this seat.",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White",I really like my South shore dresser.. The only complaint I have is that the slots are to small and its hard to find the right size basket or holder to fit. But after a search I did and it looks great in my baby daughters room. So easy to put together and its sturdy and also a great price.. I recommend this product to other mothers setting up a nursery or looking for cute furniture..,4,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This piece looked great after assembly!  I found out that I should have been more careful in putting nails in too deeply.  Some of the tips of the nails touched through the wood around the front edge of the dressing  pad frame. (I'm going to try to just carefully hammer those tips back in.  Hopefully, the finish will not crack.)I didn't feel there was a need for the piece directly above the cubbies.  I will probably take it off, for it shortens the size for bigger baskets.  Otherwise, this piece is super!!!  It looks great in my future granddaughter's nursery w/the matching chest dresser!",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This is exactly what i was looking for. After reading all the reviews I almost didn't buy it, but in the end I knew it was the one. It does take a few hours to assemble but if you take your time, make sure all the parts are there, and use the instructions (all things we normally don't do when putting together furniture but after reading the reviews, we did on this one) it will turn out perfect.",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","we knew we were not getting the $800 quality when we purchased this item. WE know we will be moving in 2 years and were not going to be taking this with us. It was fairly simple to assemble (despite being 7 months pregnant) just by carefully following the instructions, but I am quite handy and have already assemble various IKEA pieces on my own. It is pretty to look at, but I am aware it would never last 5 years or a move.One part (right on the front of the changing table part) came damaged (a big dent) but I was not about to put it all back in the box, again 7 months pregnant). I assembled it as is and am now in the process of trying to get that one piece shipped to me. Will keep you all posted.",4,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","Got this for my daughter's room. A little bit of a process to get put togther, but once done it was beautiful. The product pictures definitely do not do it justice. Excellent quality piece... I will buy again from the brand.",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","We bought this for our yet to arrive granddaughter and her parents.  My son, who has limited tools and experience, was able to assemble this table with ease.  When the assembly was complete, the table looked as good as the pictures, and seems to be a very sturdy piece of furniture.  We are finding Amazon to be a great ally in sending gifts, even large ones, to our friends and family throughout the country.",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","I got this dresser/changer to match the Graco Charleston crib and they go together fabulously. It was a big job to put together, but it looks great. The only thing is that once we inserted the drawers, they didn't seem to be centered. It doesn't bother me too much, though.",4,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White",My husband just put this changing table together for me and i love it! I watched him put it together and it seemed pretty easy to him but i guess that depends on how well you follow directions. All the parts were there. The drawers are a little small but its good for my daughters clothes. And its very sturdy. All in all a great piece of furniture.,5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This is a beautiful addition to our nursery.  Every time my husband looks at it he comments on how nice it looks.  It wasn't the easiest thing to put together, but I did it by myself at 5 months pregnant in about 2 hours (so it is very possible to do it alone).  There was one piece that just didn't seem to line up with the holes provided and took me a good 30 minutes just to figure out what to do before I finally just strong armed it and it worked.  Like the other reviewers said the drawers are plastic so they don't slide very smoothly so we will need to be careful not to just fling them open.  Also it was much larger than I'd imagined - I was picturing something along the lines of a nightstand but this is the same height as my crib and almost 3 feet wide I believe.  All in all I am very happy with the purchase since I got it on sale and I couldn't be happier with the way it looks.  Workmanship and ease of assembly is pretty good considering the price.  My baby hasn't arrived yet so I cannot comment on functionality or sturdiness, but I love that there's so much storage and the cubby holes make organizing and reaching essentials easy.",4,1
Fisher-Price Flutterbye Mobile,I bought this for my grandson. I set up a small nursery in my spare room when I knew I would be watching him when mom when back to work. I knew he liked his mobile at home and found this one reasonably priced. I didnt have any trouble putting it together and he LOVES watching the birdies. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,5,1
Sassy Bathtime Kitchen Sink,My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES playing with this in the tub.  There's so many parts to explore and it floats which fascinates him.  I highly recommend it.  The only problem may be storage (if you don't have a lot of space in your bathroom) since it's a bit large for a bath toy.,5,1
Graco DuoRider Stroller in Colburn,"This little stroller worked very well for the purpose of which it was intended, to help my daughter and daughter in law give these girls a walk every day. Both of their mothers have very sturdy single strollers, but the time came when only one of their moms could take them for a walk and this stroller worked well. Thank you. We are happy with this product.",4,1
Companion Infant Car Seat - unity,"This is my fourth infant car seat and by far is my favorite. I have used Graco Snugride, Graco SafeSeat, and Eddie Bauer Cosco. The blue fabric is much softer than the other colors. I live in South Gerogia and the baby has not over heated yet. I admit it is a heavy carrier but after carrying the safeseat it seems light. We bought this after the base of our Graco Snugride broke. I just wanted something sturdier and my 22 month old loves his Britax Marathan. By the way, our baby loves the head cushion.",5,1
Companion Infant Car Seat - unity,"The Britax Companion Carseat and Britax Preview Stroller make a great travel system.  The carseat is heavier than some others, but it is VERY SAFE and STURDY.  The straps are easy to adjust, they never twist, and my 4 week old daughter always looks comfortable and secure in it. The harness straps can be adjusted easily each time with a built-in lever found under a flap in front of the seat. It is very easy to remove and install in our Honda Element. The fabric is easy to spot clean as well.  It snaps in easily to the stroller which, by the way, is more like an umbrella stroller than the bulky strollers in most travel systems. Originally I bought the Graco Metrolite, but returned it and bought the Britax system because I felt it was safer and more durable.  The price is more expensive than most, but I see no reason to skimp when it comes to the safety of my child.  (CR rated this seat as #1 this past May.)  I also do not have to purchase an umbrella stroller later on, so in a way, I've saved money!",5,1
Companion Infant Car Seat - unity,"We used this seat for about 6 months. Our son outgrew it quickly (he was too heavy for me to carry it any longer). We liked it, and we felt that he was secure in it. He seemed comfortable. It is a deep seat, but we are comparing it to a carrier type seat we had five years ago...the head pad was never used...I don't know if our son had a large head or if it was just useless. I could not get the canopy to operate properly. This could have been my error.Overall, we would use this seat again.  It fit fine in our F150 Supercrew. I have to also say that it was hard to get it in the base at times. Sometimes I would get it in on the first try, and other times I had to rock it back and forth like the other reviewer stated.",4,1
Infantino: Bendy Bug,"This is such a cool lil worm :) Lots of cool colors and cute happy face. Makes some noise when shaken and very flexible. I wish my baby would play with it more but maybe she will as she gets older. She is 10 months now & will chew on the bug's """"ears"""" for a min and then move on",4,1
Infantino: Bendy Bug,i love this bug! especially my daughter bites the antennas =))  and its not a bug its a future butterfly-the cutterpillar,4,1
Infantino: Bendy Bug,"This is a cute, bendable toy that is fun for little hands to hold.  Our 9month old granddaughter loves it.",5,1
Infantino My First Puzzles,My son loves this puzzle.  He's had it since he was one but only really started to do it when he was two.  He will sit for hours doing puzzles and especially this one.  He loves to jumble up the pieces and put them back together.,5,1
Infantino Giggle Ball Toy Set,"This is a very cute little set for an infant. Our daughter just turned 8 months old and plays with this set for awhile. It's one of the few toys that keeps her attention...unlike remotes, newspapers...lolI would definitely recommend this set for baby!",5,1
"Babe Ease Original Clean Shopper, Blue Zoo","I have been using this product for at least 6 months. I have been very pleased with it. I find that it DOES fit in the Costco cart. The side flaps JUST fit over the sides, but the side flaps aren't as secure in the Costco cart. However, because my year-old daughter is not much of a squirmer in the cart it doesn't pull away from the sides for me. I have been very pleased with this product and for the price, I would buy it again if needed.  I also purchased an over-the-seat leather trash bag holder for my car and this fits perfectly inside it, so we always have it when we get to the store. My cart cover has also been washed multiple times and holds up well.",5,1
"Babe Ease Original Clean Shopper, Blue Zoo",Purchased this for my toddler.  It is very durable.  Washed it in hot water dozens of times and it still retained its color.  Was able to use it for my next child four years later!  A great buy!,5,1
"Babe Ease Original Clean Shopper, Blue Zoo",It does what it exactly says. There is not lots of cushion but it prevents the baby from sucking the filthy handle on shopping carts.,5,1
Classic PoohTM Flannel Receiving Blankets - Blue (4-pk.),"I had added these receiving blankets to my registry because they fit the Classic Pooh theme we'd chosen for the baby's nursery.  Within a week of our daughter's birth, my husband and I were back at Target, buying a second 4-pack of these blankets.  They are wonderful!  They are soft flannel, but fairly thin, so they are very easy (and quick) to launder, and they are not too warm.  We use them to swaddle her, to line her bassinet (between numerous sheet changes), to cover her during the day (at night we use a sleepsack, for safety), to prop her head in the car seat, as a privacy shield while breastfeeding in public, etc.  We have found so many uses for them, and we launder at least a few daily.  They are holding up extremely well.  I highly recommend them!UPDATE:  Five months -- and dozens of washes -- later, these little blankets are still going strong!  They are SO practical...",5,1
Evenflo Triumph Deluxe Convertible Car Seat Fairview,"This is a really pretty car seat.  Very plush upholstery. The directions are a little cryptic, but you really need to read them to use this product.  The harness is counter intuitive to what I was used to.  Basically, you have to adjust the straps with the little knob on the side.  Loosen it before the baby goes in the seat.  fasten the buckle around the baby and then tighten the straps with the knob. Voila!Good seat, just takes some finesse.",4,1
Evenflo Triumph Deluxe Convertible Car Seat Fairview,I read the consumer reports to make sure I was getting the best seat for my baby and this was rated in their top 5.  Well worth it too.  I'm not sure what the others are complaining about with the seatbelts and straps but I've not had any troubles at all.  The knob on the side works great for me as far as loosening or tightening the straps. I'm using this as a forward facer for my 19 month old.  It sits a bit high in my explorer but we're getting used to it. I'm seriously considering getting another one for our other car.,5,1
Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat Fleetwood,"I would say it is one of the best products from Evenflo. Really easy to fit and confortable for kids. Only con is you need to remove the seat to recline to another position. But it does not matter to me, so is it to my kid.",4,1
Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat Fleetwood,"I purchased this directly from Amazon in 2007.  It cost $55 back then.  It came within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping (which is basically standard shipping).Looks just like the picture, nothing was damaged during the shipping.  Material was all brand new and clean.  Came with everything that it said it would.  I never used it in the infant position, as my son had already outgrown that position, even though he was only seven months old at that time.  I used it on him all the way up until he was almost three.It's never been recalled and I've never had a problem with it.",5,1
Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat Fleetwood,I was very impressed with this seat.  I got it on sale and was axpecting something cheap.  I just needed something quickly for my ever growing twins.  The fabric is very nice and the padding is adequate.  I love the removable bottom liner.  It came in handy when one of my guys got carsick on vacation.,4,1
NEW - Tupperware Shape-O Toy,My daughter had one of these Tupperware balls when she was little. I bought this one for our grand babies to play with at out house. Still the same color and the same great products.  The shapes can be used as cookie cutters or bread cutters for fun snacks and stuff too.,5,1
Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Cotton Knit Small 7-14 Pounds In Blue,"My son has always slept better when swaddled, but he quickly outgrew traditional and long sized receiving blankets.  This product has been the best sleeping aid for him, I only wish I had invented it!!  When he is snuggled in this, he falls right to sleep.  He naps more soundly and he will sleep a 6-8 hour stretch at night (he's now ten weeks old).  When I try to put him to bed without it, he usually wakes up within 20-40 minutes fussy and still tired.  The only downfall was that he did outgrow the small, but I was thrilled to find out they also sold it in large!  It's fairly inexpensive and well worth buying more than one!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Sage","The product is well made and looks very cute. Unfortunately my baby did not like the ""restraint"" at all, so we did not use it.If i have to buy it again i would buy a size bigger as i found that they run rather small.",4,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Sage","I absolutely loved the SwaddleMe wraps. They are swaddling made simple-especially great for grandparents and baby sitters that might not know how to swaddle a baby really well. I purchased 2 of them, but encountered a problem with one of my SwaddleMe wraps. One was the cotton wrap and the other was the cotton flannel. The cotton wrap stretched out very easily, so my baby boy could get his arms out and would wake up. The cotton flannel was the best choice for us. This did not lose its shape and kept him snug through the night. Most nights, my 2.5 month old will sleep from 7pm to 5:30am w/ out waking up. He eats at 5:30am then goes right back to sleep, swaddled. This is a great thing to have, especially when the receiving blankets you've received are all the smaller size.",4,1

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Yellow","Our little 2 month old has been swaddled up nightly in these blankets since we discovered them.  We were swaddling her the old-fashioned way in blankets until I found these.  These are easy easy easy!  Also work great in warm weather, seems like the perfect amount of warmth for her, without her getting overheated even on warm nights. She loves these blankets-- they calm her right now even at her fussiest moments!",5,1
Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Collegiate Pattern: Jefferson Tan,"My daughter loves this seat - plain and simple. It's easy to install securely in almost any vehicle, and getting her in an out is a breeze.  We love the design and ease of use - long straps with plenty of slack and the buckle pad around the leg area (lower buckles) that protect the baby from getting pinched or uncomfortable from the tight straps.This is a perfect buy for us that I'd recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from a baby/infant seat.  She certainly loves resting in it or taking in all the sights as we drive along.",5,1
Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller,"My wife and I brought the sit and stroll a while back and have used it on a number of occassions.  It's an excellent idea and very functional.  I have no problem converting it from a seat to a stroller and back again with our daughter in it, although my wife struggles with it a little bit.For vacations, the sit and stroll is a godsend, I like the fact that it will fit with both car seat belts and has an attatched latch system (the latter of which I think is much more secure)There are some drawbacks, these being:1) The handle seems rather flimsy,2) The stroller doesn't like being pushed off deep curbs.  The front wheels seem to jam underneath it and it requires you to lift the unit forward with your foot before you can proceed,3) Our child is of a size where she is between rear-facing and forward facing.  We cannot put her forward facing right now because she is too small and the belt is at her throat (when it should be across her chest), but rear facing, her legs are scrunched up against the rear of the car seat.  There is no way I can install it with her in it at this size which makes putting her in the seat difficult.  This will cease to be a problem when she is bigger and forward facing, but it is a problem now.4) I have no idea how you install this rear facing in an aircraft, there just isn't enough room between seats (certainly in economy class).  Most airlines insist the seat is forward facing anyway and we have settled for latching the aircraft seat belt through the mechanism on the back of the unit.5) I wish the guides that the car/airplane belts ran through were raised a little higher on the seat, when a belt is in place it runs very tight across my daughters legs or chest, restricting her movement significantly.These aren't major gripes though.  In all, we have been very satisfied with the seat.  I would recommend it, it makes travelling with a little one significantly easier",4,1
Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller,My husband and I bought this for our 12mth old for a family trip.  It saved us time and space.  We absolutely recommend the Car Seat/Stroller to anyone who doesn't want to carry a car seat and stroller.  It is still comfortable for our daughter who is 20 months now.,5,1
Lilly Gold Sit 'n Stroll 5-in-1 Combination Car Seat/Stroller,"We bought this for our vacation (flight) for our newborn.  We use it everyday now!  Everywhere we go, people comment about it.  It's not pretty but so practical!  It's awesome!  Just be sure to make sure the handle is locked when setting up into stroller. I didn't lock it and it fell into car seat mode.  Luckily my son slept through it!  I felt horrible, it was in front of the security at the airport.  You do have to put it through the security machine.  I think it's the greatest invention!  Definitely worth every penny.",5,1
Just Born Iridescent Moon Soft Wall Art,"We've had these for over a year now, hanging above my daughter's changing table and I still love them! She loves looking at them (and now trying to take them off the wall).",5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"Fun but fragile. Not a toy for youngsters, but fun for a science class. I am able to demonstrate STP to my science class.",5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),the kids loved these.  it really appears like you are holding onto a hot glass filled with boiling water.this is another great novelty for the science classroom.,5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"I received this undamaged and it was a huge hit for a stocking stuffer for my older teenage son.  He treats it with great care and it worked instantly and every time as the liquid would bubble up to the top with the heat of your hand.  It is delicate by design as it works by heat of your hand so a thick glass would in my opinion, probibly not transfer the heat.  Great teenager gift for novelty sake.",5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),Its an ok item that's the reason I rated this item as (it's ok)I think its cool and fun for people to look atI recommend this item to everyone,4,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"I bought these for my daughter's 7th birthday.  They are incredibly fragile, but we've been very careful so far and haven't had any accidents.  You can actually feel the bubbling through the glass, which is cool.  Everybody loves these.  I bought several and fortunately whoever packed this put different colors, which I appreciate because they are all different shapes.  I wish I had ordered 4 to get the whole set instead of just 3!",5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"I bought these to show to my young grandchildren who are homeschooled.  Yes, the glass is delicate and you don't want to drop them, but you should have seen their faces when the liquid inside started filling the top while they were holding the bottom.  Then it actually looks like it is boiling with bubbles going through it on the top.  I showed them how to hold the top bulb in their hand to send all the liquid back into the bottom.  What a great learning tool for kids!  I keep mine in a display cabinet and only let them use it with supervision, only because they are so young and could drop it.  The older kids can handle these better and seem to quickly understand that they are made of thin glass and could break.  The kids have asked to try these again and again and even want to show their friends... almost like a magic trick, but its really physics.",5,1
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),"it boiled in hand and looked cool, for the two dollars we got a excellent amount of fun out of it. It is very fragile and wont take being dropped at all.",4,1
Combi Savvy EX Stroller - Claret,"This stroller is light weight, easy to manuever, fold and carry.Great for travel and every day strolls. It reclines, has a big sun shade, cup holder, insulated bottle holder & a zip pouch for keys etc. The only thing we'd like to see improved on Combi strollers is the under seat storage, we'd like more room. You can stash a couple small - med bags under the seat, but don't plan a shopping spree at the mall with this stroller. This is a great stroller & very sturdy, it's my 2nd combi - I only bought a new one because I needed a new infant car seat and the Combi Connection seat wouldn't fit on my old (6yrs) Combi Savvy Travel Stroller. Everyone I know who has a big Graco travel system hates it - so buyer beware.",5,1

Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Although I was apprehensive, this was a perfect fit for all of the stuffed and furry items in my kids bedroom.  Although not toddlers any more, my pre-teen has this above the buckbed in the corner.  Can't easily be reached by the dog (that's really important as the dog gets 'confused' as to which is a doggie toy and which isn't), but once up in the bed, all is accessible.  Easy to install too.great price for something which works so well.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Holds all my stuffed animals of every size. Very lightweight, yet strong netting. I naively used command strips to hold it up and the strips were strong enough, so as long as you nail the hooks in the wall, you'll be fine.",5,1

Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,I love this hammock.  It's durable & not only holds all her stuffed animals but keeps them all displayed (not crammed together so she forgets about them).  We keep the hammock low enough so she can go & get which ever stuffed animal she pleases.  It's turned the corner of her room from a junky catch all corner to a tidy play area.  I am pleased with the purchase.  It also helps if you have pets that think toys left on the floor are fair game.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"This is a good strong net that can hold lots of stuffed toys.  I had a problem with too many stuffed animals for my infant, so this was a GREAT solution for the time being.  She does enjoy staring at the toys in the net, but until the time comes, they are safe and secure in abundancy at a distance.  Definately worth the price and arrived very quickly.",5,1

Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"holds tons of toys, we have about 35 stuffed animals in there now and could fit more. it has some stretch so that is nice.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This toy hammock has been a lifesaver. My 2 1/2 year old has so many stuffed animals and I was having trouble keeping them organized and not all over his room. The hammock was easy to install and holds a lot of weight. It is very stretchy and can hold larger toys with no problem. The price was very reasonable for such a high quality item.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,I have had lots of pet nets as we called them but this is the best. Mainly because it is very large and can hold a lot of stuffed animals including the big ones,5,1

Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This was a gift for a young lady. She has many stuffed animals and really needed a convenient way to store and display them.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This hammock was much bigger and better made than I expected. We bought a second one for the other bedroom.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,Just the right size to hang over our sons bed and keep all his stuffed animals close by. No problems with this transaction.,5,1

Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"These feeders are so handy. The handles are perfect for little hands and they hold cookies, apple and orange slices nicely! A great idea for my baby who watches her sister eat snacks and can now have her own! I've also put ice in there to help soothe her gums when she's teething.",5,1
Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"My baby is still young, but I used this because her gums were hurting- she hates her teething ring and I'm too nervous to let her gnaw on a chunk of frozen fruit.  But at the suggestion of my husband, I put a frozen cube of milled pear that I made in the feeder and she loved it!  I didn't have to worry about her getting any chunks and unlike some feeders, these bags are mesh fabric, not plastic so no little bits to break off.  It was pretty easy to clean, just strong stream of hot water and a sponge.  It did require a few tries to get all of the bits of strained pear out, but it didn't take long at all.  Although, if left to sit for even a few minutes, I imagine it would be a great deal more difficult.  I'm very happy with this product and it's been a great way to introduce foods to my daughter (who also dislikes baby spoons!).",5,1

Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I (or I should say, my boy) like(s) Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles very much. This set comes with only two levels of nipples (level one and level two). As the child grows bigger, the nipples needs to be changed. There are five levels (Preemie, One, Two, Three, and Four) of nipples and a ""Y-cut"" nipple. The higher the level of the nipple, the faster the flow. If the baby refuse the bottle, there is a possiblity that the nipple is either a level too high or too low. Just need to pay attention to this, and you won't have problems with these bottles.Well of course these bottles takes more time to wash, but as long as the baby feels good, it will actually save time (hay, just feed him/her and he/she's happy and go directly to sleep).",5,1
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"My oldest had terrible colic and if I had known to get Dr. Browns the first time I would have.  So I did for the second baby and I could not be happier.  The system is great, the cleaning of them is fine and easy I just stick in the dishwasher in the top rack.  You can get nipples to adjust to age, and I will probably use them through the first year.  They do tend to be leaky if you have them upside down for too long so beware when you are traveling or if you have it in a bag....if it is laying upside down when there is milk in it, it will fill into the cap and when you open the cap it all pours out.Other than that I would definitely get these bottles again.",5,1
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I am a breastfeeding mom and I had a hard time to get either one of my daughters to take a bottle. I tried EVERY bottle out there, and Dr. Brown's bottles seem to be the ONLY bottles my daughters would accept. This may be due to the fact that Dr. Brown's nipples do not collapse when the babies suck, the nipple is perfect shape and size, the flow is consistent and the unique design eliminates the air bubbles, so there's definitely less gas than we experienced while trying other bottles.I took away one of the stars because of the minor problems we had with this set: these bottles require more time and effort to clean, they leak occasionally [no, I didn't fill them above the line and no, I did not overtighten them - have no idea why they leaked], the larger bottles do not fit in most of the insulated bottle totes that come with diaper bags or sold exclusively for baby bottles [and that was a little bit of a problem for us, because we only use bottles when going places, but we solved it by using a larger/taller insulated lunch bag from Ikea store] and the 4-oz bottles that come in this set will be outgrown pretty quickly. My younger daughter is 7 weeks old and she eats 4 oz per feeding and looks like she could eat more if only the bottle would hold more...I would recommend getting a set of 3 9-oz Dr. Brown's bottles as it looks like a better value and will serve you longer (you can pour as little milk or formula in a 9 oz bottle as you need, while 4 oz bottles will only hold 4 oz max, and will be useless in a couple of months at the latest).",4,1
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I found that these bottles did help my son have less gas, but they are very hard to clean.  As opposed to just wiping out the bottle with a brush, and then cleaning the nipple and collar, you have a small tube that you must use a small brush for (this is included with the bottles).  This is no big deal, but the apparatus under the nipple that the tube attaches to is nearly impossible to keep clean, because of all the crevices it has.  I found myself trying to clean it with any brush (bottle brush, nipple brush, even the little tube brush that was included) I could find, and then giving up and trying to scrub it as best I could and then re-sterilize it.  I believe we actually threw away some of these pieces out because we could not get them clean enough.  Then we had to go out and buy whole new bottles, because you can't just buy that piece on its own.  So, I would recommend this bottle if your child is gassy and unhappy, but I would definitely say be prepared for a lot of time cleaning formula out of its nooks and crannies.",4,1

"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Exactly what I wanted: a super soft, easily washable, nice looking cover that's easy to put on the changing table pad.  Will be buying another. Best cover out there. Its nice that the cover has holes for the changing table straps too. Bought the same thing in crib mattress size too and my baby girl loves it.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","This is a changing pad cover, it does what it is made to do. It helps so that you don't put the baby down on the cold changing pad plastic material",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",It's very soft for baby although it doesn't seem to fit the pad exactly right. I like the color and the slits that allow for the straps of the safety closure to come through and be secured around baby so he doesn't fall off the changing table.,4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","There's not a product picture for it, but it works with the LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&#34; (which I LOVE). It's soft on baby and still looks great after all those washes.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Very soft, nice baby blue color. However description states that it's for a contoured changing pad but when I put it on there's some room between the middle of the pad and the cover. It's not tight, when baby gets placed on it, it conforms but when baby's not on it it's lifted.",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","This cover doesn't fit quite as nicely as the one that came with the same size summer infant pad, but for the price I really can't complain.  It's soft and I love the color.  I'd buy it again but Amazon won't let me.  (Limit 1 per customer) *sad face*",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",This changing pad cover is made of  nice soft minky like micro fiber.  It washed well and fits perfectly and was a great price.,4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",I purchased this before our little one was born.  The fabric is very soft and it fit my changing pad perfectly. I only had one cover which I didn't think was a problem until I realized that baby's grandparents and the sitter couldn't change a poopy diaper without it ending up all over the cover.  After washing it almost everyday I broke down and purchased another. The first one us held up well to the 24/7 use and constant washing!,5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",I really like this cover - I bought 2 so that I can have a clean one when one is in the washer. I've been using these for over 5 months now and they look like new. They are so soft and fit well on my Munchkin changing pad. The color was a bit brighter green than I expected but it's still a nice color.,5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I love this changing pad cover. It is very soft and the color is the same as seen in the picture. My only reason for not giving it five stars is that is a little tight on a standard size changing pad. It does stretch out, but is a bit cumbersome getting back on the pad after each wash. However, this was not enough of a reason to make me not purchase it again-this is my second one!",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",This is a soft material that is great for changing on because it doesn't get &#34;cold&#34; and instead the baby loves it.,5,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","my kid likes a warm and and snuggle place to change her, so tried to change her on just the plastic and it was to cooled for her so i bought this cover! it easy on easy off and easy to wash !",5,1

Eden Baby Doll in Sleeper,I think that anyone who has a baby girl should get one. I gave my 10month old granddaughter one for Christmas and she loves her baby. She'll crawl/roll across the room to get her. I suggest that anyone going to a baby shower should get this as a present. The packaging that is used to send her in is wonderful. When you open it you get the feeling that there's going to be a lot of love given! Thanks to the maker.,5,1
Tupperware Ideal Little Bowl Set,I love them. They are the perfect size for what I need them for. The different colors add to their attractiveness. That are handy for small needs.,5,1
Tupperware 2 Toddler Size Divided Dishes with Seals in Various Colors,"These bowls are nice and sturdy, just like I expected them to be.  They are just the right size for my daughter's lunch.  The only issue is that the lids are somewhat hard to get on.  Just takes a little practice, though.  I definitely think we'll get more than our money's worth out of these.",4,1
Koala Baby Cozy Blanket - Blue,I received this blanket as a gift. I really love it and so does my new baby! It is so soft and cozy. He loves being bundled in it! It still looks great after a few washes too! I think it is a nice classy looking blanket for when baby is dressed up or going somewhere important.,5,1
BabyBjorn Baby Sitter 1-2-3 - Black Gingham,"My 5 month old son loves this.  I can rock him or he can gently rock himself.  Light weight, good quality construction, easy to fold, easy to clean.  You couldn't ask for a better chair.",5,1
Mini Co-Sleeper,"We LOVE this co-sleeper bassinet! How wonderful to have your baby right next to you & be able to just reach down to pick them up so easily. Perfect for breastfeeding moms. It makes it so easy to feed him in the middle of the night without having to get out of bed. It's also nice to look over & be reassured that he's breathing.They don't recommend this, but I have used other bassinet sheets (not meant for the Arms Reach co-sleeper) just as back up sheets & they seem to be just fine. The mattress pad idea sounds great (per the other reviewer). I think  I'll give that a shot too because it would be nice if the mattress were waterproof.I love this product & would recommend it to anyone (even moms who aren't breastfeeding). =)",5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural",I needed the extensions for my ideal cosleeper. Works perfectly. I have a bed height of about 32 inches. Totally keeps my twins at arms reach. Which it's perfect through out the night,5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural",These leg extensions worked perfectly and match our co-sleeper color exactly.  This has been a great purchase and we would recommend it to others needing something similar for a co-sleeper.,5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural",Product fit perfectly to existing co-sleeper. Raised it up to the height of our bed.  Product would have been unstable if not attached to the bed though.,5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural","I agree that this product is grossly overpriced for what it is.  These are just plastic pieces that snap onto the legs of the Co-Sleeper bassinet to raise it higher.  But, they do the trick.  The directions state that you are not supposed to use these extensions without securing the bassinet to your bed.  Otherwise, the bassinet would not be stable at all.  But when it is attached to the bed, it is very stable.  I had to raise my bassinet 4 inches so I used two of these for each leg.  I love the bassinet now that it is at the same level as my bed.  I can so easily see and reach my baby at night.  I think these should be at least half the price that they are, but I wanted to get the part that actually went with the co-sleeper rather than parts from another manufacturer.",4,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural","Easy to install and made the co sleeper perfect! Wish I'd bought them when I first purchased the bed! Looks great, too!",5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural","I don't know why people complain about these. Based on the Amazon reviews for this product, at first I purchased a set of bed raisers at Bed, Bath and Beyond instead of the official Arm's Reach extenders. I didn't like the bed raisers because the bases are wider than the tops, and so the co-sleeper ended up being positioned with about an inch gap from my bed. It also felt a bit rickety since the co-sleeper legs rest on top of the bed raisers vs. lock into them.This 'official' product, on the other hand, works great and provides a lot of stability when the co-sleeper is secured to the side of our bed using the included safety strap pulled under our bed mattress. We needed to use all 3 leg extensions, and it feels pretty sturdy - much sturdier than the bed raisers felt.",5,1

Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,I purchased these trays to freeze my sons home made baby food. I used them for about 10 months total and they're still in great shape. The food never got freezer burned while in the trays and it was easy to pop the cubes out to store in bags after they were frozen. They held up great in the dishwasher also.,5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,I bought these to freeze my homemade baby food.  They work great and I will probably be ordering more to freeze larger batches.,5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I bought these so that when I make big batches of homemade baby food I can freeze them into little cubes and only take out what I need. I do not put these in the dishwasher, I only hand wash them and I've never had any problems with lids not fitting and so on. I also don't store my baby food in these containers. I usually only let food stay in them for a day, maybe two, and then remove and place into plastic ziplock bags. I have found that it's a little tricky getting the food out sometimes, but that doesn't bother me. It always comes out eventually. I either run it under hot water for a second or whack it on the counter until they comes loose. They are great heavy duty trays and I love them!! I would recommend them to anyone!",5,1

Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,I puree steamed veggies all the time for my Sneaky Chef recipes and use these trays all the time.  They work great and I like that they are BPA free.  Also good for ice cubes b/c the covers help with evaporation.,5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"These trays are great for making and freezing your own baby food and freezing breast milk. I also use them to freeze extra chicken broth, tomato paste, or whatever else I want to freeze for later. They wash great in the dishwasher.",5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"So easy to make food in bathes and store in the freezer this way. It saved me a lot of time, since I worked, I could make food and my mom could use it. Still home made, though not totally fresh.  But I could use fresh veggies and make betetr than jarred food.",5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,The lids snap on really well and it was easy to pop out the cubes of breast milk by running a little hot water over the back.,5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,I really like these cube trays. It is a little hard to get the cubes out but I think if you spray them with vegetable oil it will be easier I just haven't tried it yet. So far I have been very pleased. I like that they have lids.,5,1
BABY BJORN Baby Sitter 123 City Blue,"I bought this chair because of its looks.  It is not plastic and covered with loud, ridiculous toys.  Fortunately our son loves it, more than I could have imagined.  He will sit and hang out in the seat anytime.  This has been a product we could not live without.  It is lightweight so we can move him from room to room without any problems.  We also fold it flat and stick it the car for trips to Grandmas house.  A must have!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus Cradler Adjustable Head Support for Newborns to Toddlers, Ivory Teddy Bears","I bought this for my  second son's infant carseat before he was born.  My first son always had a slumpy head in his carseat and  the rainbow shaped head supports were useless.  This  works great.  It did a wonderful job of keeping his head supported even when we were comming home from the hospital and I am still using it today, 5 mos. later.  I wish I would have had one for my older son, and I would definately recommend it.",5,1
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe Single Stroller / Jogger Sunshade Attachment in Black,"This item is GREAT!  I have a 5 month old and a 3 year old.  I was looking for something to help protect the baby from the sun so we could still be out doing all the fun summer things with our 3 year old and this works great.  I have used it with my single regular stroller, my umbrella stroller (it has a small canopy to attach to, and on the front portion of my sit n stand stroller.  It has worked great with all three strollers in all weather conditions and it wraps up into a small carrying case!  Think I am getting a double to attach to the rented theme park strollers for the rest of the summer!",5,1
Protect-a-Bub Classic Sunshade - Twin - Black,"Yes, if you are looking for a sunshade that actually does the job then this is a great product for you. I have found it to be somewhat annoying that every time I want to use it I have to tie it on and adjust it so the kids don't get sun in their eyes. And if I ever want to check on them or someone wants to talk to them they have to lift up the shade and it usually just falls back down b/c it is so flimsy. It does do its job and is pretty easy to store and keep in your car so you have it on hand.",4,1
Protect-a-Bub Classic Sunshade - Twin - Black,"I know this seems a bit much to pay for a sunshade, but it's definitely a high quality product.  I use it with my double stroller all the time, and it is flexible and easy to store.  Very happy I purchased this!",5,1
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe Single Stroller/ Jogger Sunshade Attachment Navy,"As everyone else has mentioned, this is the Classic Sunshade, not the Deluxe.  However, as someone else also pointed out, this is still a better price than the Classic so I bought it full well knowing I would not be getting the Deluxe.  It works well on my umbrella stroller (UppaBaby), so I imagine it'll be even better on my full size.",4,1
Walker With Toy Bar,"This walker was very easy to assemble and it has multiple uses- We use it to keep our 9 month old from being underfoot, she uses it to practice standing and my 2 year old uses it to push his stuffed animals around!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Mobile with Remote Control,"Where would I be without this mobile...getting out of bed every 7 minutes, that's where!  I LOVE this mobile.  The only reason I deducted half a star is because it only plays songs and doesn't have wave sound effects like the aquarium does (another fine toy).  I'd rather listen to waves instead of lullibies, but the remote feature more than makes up for it.  Yes there are some nights when I have to use the remote three time until the baby falls asleep, but I'd rather roll over and smack the remote than have to get completely out of bed to restart the mobile.",5,1
Ameda Purely Yours Carry All Breast Pump Traveler Backpack,"Overall this is a good pump.  I can usually pump one feeding per sitting in the 30 minute time slot we get at work, but only if I keep adjusting the suction and cycle.  The flange it comes with is too big for me and would hurt while I was pumping, but I ordered an insert to make it smaller and everything fits better now.  The reason I why I chose this over the Medela Pump In Style is because of the price and the fact that I don't have to worry about milk backing up in the tubes, unlike with the Medela PIS.  This may not be the top of the line electric pump, but I can't complain.  It gets the job done and is saving me tons of $$$ in what could be formula cost.",4,1
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,I bought this for a shower gift.  It was unique and much appreciated by the Mom-to-be.,5,1
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"Haven't used it myself but have warned those whom I have given one: Don't use as much water as the directions say! It will set up nicer with less. Only going by others' reviews! So far, everyone's been happy!",5,1
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"This makes a wonderful gift.  An easy, compact memory to cherish. Love the colorful tins!  Good value for the money",5,1
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"This product worked well for me, however the directions that come with the tin are wrong.  It says to add 1/4 cup of water and stir for the first tin.  It should say add 1/8 cup water and stir!  The first tin is so tiny, 1/4 cup of water turns the plaster into soup!  I ended up having to take some plaster powder from the 2nd year tin in order to get it the right consistency!  The finished product turned out well though and overall I'm happy with it.A tip: Wipe some Pam cooking spray on your child's hand before pressing it into the plaster.  It really helps!!Good luck!",4,1
Summer Booster to Toddler Seat,We like the adjustable height. It will come in handy as our grand-baby grows. The belts and straps were not much of a challenge and provide the added security necessary. The accessory cups that attach to the arms were not useful except for dipping elbows and providing amusement when they detached...,5,1

Alpha Sport 3-in-1 Convertible Car Seat - Rugby,I went to babies r us for this carseat and was pleased to find it I have a newborn son and he sits in it fine the headrest is a bit small but it still works its easy to install and switch between cars (Which I do alot) I took it on a trip and it worked very well on the plane I love this carseat.,5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I was so sad when my little one out grew this. It's those times when he's sleeping and I don't want to wake him up that I think about this stroller. Up grade tips.. when your little one outgrows this.. please consider getting theJoovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Red(very compact stroller) and theGraco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix(awesome convertible car seat). BTW: the Graco Snug Ride in Black/Platinum looks great with this.",4,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I am glad we purchased the Graco Snugrider.  We keep it in the car and use for quick trips shopping or running errands. The basket is a generous size.  It doesn't ride as smoothly as we would like, but for the price you can't beat it.  I do not reccomend it as your only stroller, as I do not think it would do well on bumpy sidewalks, or any less than smooth surface.",4,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I purchased this item as the regular stroller does not fit in the trunk of my car, making it impossible to do any serious walking with my baby. This stroller frame was easy to put together, all the pieces snap into place, and is very compact, fitting easily into the trunk of my 2000 Mustang. The ride is smooth, and there are usually no complaints out of my little one when we are out and about. The car seat snaps easily into place, and the basket is sturdy enough to place purchases from the local farmers market. I highly recommend this stroller frame.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"We recently returned the Snap N Go we received at our shower for this one and I am so glad.  It looks better, fits the Snugride better and has a bigger, easier to access basket.  It was well worth the few extra dollars!",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I have had this stroller for a year and I love it.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so I need to avoid lifting heavy things.  At 15 pounds, this stroller is easy to lift in and out of my trunk.  It is really easy to maneuver through tiny aisles.  The wheels are smooth and turn with ease.  The basket holds a lot of stuff.  It will hold a large bag (or even two), but I recommend placing the bag into the basket prior to setting the car seat on to the stroller.  I leave the bag open so i can access whatever I need after the car seat is in place (or you could use smaller bags and still pull them out from the back).  Note: this stroller is so lightweight that if your (heavy) diaper bag is hanging on the handles, without the car seat in place or other weight in the basket, the stroller may tip over.My only complaint is that the release button (which unlocks the stroller from it's collapsed position) sometimes gets stuck and I struggle to open it.  Sometimes the release button does not catch and I prefer it that way.  I'd honestly rather break the button because I don't think it is necessary to lock it in this position since it lays flat in my car anyway.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind purchasing a new stroller when the baby is ready to ride without the car seat.  I still think it has been really worth it.  Now, since our family is growing, I am looking at the Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller.  It is only 21 lbs and it fits two children and has good reviews.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"Seriously, I LOVE my stroller frame. It is small enough to take anywhere and fit in almost any vehicle. It;s easy to open and close and very lightweight but durable. My son was BIG and heavy. 14 pounds at 2 months old. This stroller was awesome, sturdy and reliable. The large basket underneath was great. I even put groceries in it when I had to get just a few things at the store. This stroller is best used for quick trips in the grocery store where u don't need a basket, the mall, office, outdoor fairs, parades, museums, walks on sidewalks or smooth roads. That's what I used it for and it was a Godsend! I don't recommend it for beaches, rocky trails, rough roads, or grass. Only fits with the 2-3 carseats they list. I unfortuantely bought the snugride 32. The carseat itself was great, but my son surpassed the weigh limit by 5 months old, although most babies prolly won't. I would recommend to all mothers to by the infant carseat with the 30 pound weight limit, not the 22 pound one. Good luck and enjoy your time with your baby while their still a baby! I sure did.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"If you are a Mom or Dad on the go, you must have this stroller. It is so light and easy to take anywhere. Forget that gigantic stroller system that takes up the entire back or trunk of your car and use this headache free stroller frame. Storage underneath and cupholders are an added bonus.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I love this product! After having back surgery, it's very hard for me to lift my daughter in her car seat. I open this up in one swift click and snap on the car seat and viola! It's so simple, light weight and convenient. I don't go anywhere without it.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I was never a big stroller user - so when I had my last baby (there's an 8 year gap between him and his brother) I thought long an hard on wether I should even get one.  I clearly remembered the hastle of the big bulky one that I had with my 1st child.  How it was so wide it was hard to take shopping, barely fit into my trunk - leaving NO space for other items and just what a pain in the but it was to fold up and most importantly how I had to sort of bend over to push it because the handles were too low.With that in mind I looked long and hard for a stoller that would meet my expectations.  I wanted something that was A)easy to close and open.  B)something that had tall enough handles that I wouldn't have to huntch over to push it.  C)something affordable/durable for the little amount of use I anticipated it would really get out of me - remember I wasn't a big fan of strollers the first time around so I hardly ever used it.Other features that were important to me was a storage basket for the diaper bag and some sort of cup holder/bottle holder.When I saw this I thought how hoaky - it's just a frame...but then I really got behind it.  It's light, easy to fold/open.  Wasn't bulky, had a basket on the bottom, and what I really loved was the adjustable angle for the push handles.  I'm 5'7"" and it seems like alot of strollers are made for people shorter than me so this was a great incentive to get it.  The price was very resonable too.Long story short - I bought it and used it until my son grew out of it.  I loved it - didn't have any complaints and if I had to do it all over again I'd buy the same one.  I wish that this one was around when I had my 1st kid - shopping, going for walks and travling was MUCH easier with this stroller than it was with the big bulky one I had years ago.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I absolutley love this stroller!!!  We live in Japan where things are small...stores, streets, & trains.  This is the perfect alternative to a cumbersome full-size stroller.  Super easy to put together and the basket holds a full diaper bag.  Turns on a dime and folds up easily--what more could you ask for?  Only downside is that with the carseat in place it is a little difficult to reach the basket, but, if you place the diaper bag with the opening facing you it can still be accessed by reaching in.  I am not looking forward to giving this up when our little one outgrows her carseat.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,awesome item highly recommended for parents with newborns must have the infant safe seat or snug ride,5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"After my first child, I knew I didn't want a clunky travel system, and I have no regrets with buying this!  It's very easy to maneuver, light and great to plop the carseat on in a hurry.  After my daughter outgrew the carseat, we went straight to a lightweight umbrella stroller.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"Overall, this product does exactly what I need it to do.  I just wish it were a bit more sturdy-feeling, like the Graco stroller I had before.",4,1
Chicco Caddy Stroller in Navy,"Great value for money stroller which served it's purpose well. We wanted a stroller for travelling and to take on the plane. This stroller was very light weight, easy to fold and the two recline positions were put to good use when my daughter was sleeping.",5,1
Chicco Caddy Stroller in Navy,Fabulous stroller.  Easy to fold up & unfold.  The only drawback is its not made for tall adults to push.  Manuverability is great!,4,1
Kel - Gar Tubbly - Bubbly Hippo,"It fits very well, however, I had to make a hole to be able to use the valve. The easiest way to put it on was to take the spout out of the tub and push it hard until the cover (hippo) was on. Our daughter likes it and it looks nice. I'd probably have to keep it there until we move out of the house, to take it off is probably as hard as to put it on. I think it is safe as the rubber is thick enough to protect well in case the baby hits her head on it.",4,1
Kel - Gar Tubbly - Bubbly Hippo,"Even with our shower diverter on the spot my husband was able to add a little lube and wedge it on. Our 6 month old loves the way the water is spread out when it comes out of the Hippos mouth. Its made of hard but flexible rubber, works great for bumpy heads. Everything we could have asked for",5,1
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","When we first got this, I was really worried about the visor being so tall.  Well, it's tall, but it does fold down.  You have to unclip it and push it back.  Also, the front bumper does fold down.  There are two buttons under the fabric.  Then you pull the bumper forward (it isn't easy the first time) and push it down.  You may want a second person to help you.  I found this out from contacting Chicco, because the information was not in the manual.  This is important if you need to store the backpack in the overhead area on an airplane.  Also, the top clip cuts across my chest is a strange place.  I am short, so that maybe the issue.  I'm going to see if my tailor can move it up a little bit.  This may seem like a lot of exceptions, but it is a good piece of equipment to have.  It was a great option to have on our vacation to Chicago and surrounding areas.  Sometimes a stroller was good, but other times a backpack was the way to go.",4,1
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","I wasn't wearing this pack right the first two times but my husband who has a lot of experience with mountaineering and using heavy metal frame packs showed me how to wear it and it's much better now.  The waist strap needs to be low right above your hips and the plastic bar needs to sit right above your butt or tailbone. This puts more of the weight on your hips and less on the shoulders. So much better! It does not tell you how to wear it in the instructions. My 1yr old really likes it. it's like a little seat she gets secured in and she falls right to sleep. The sun shade is ok, I wish it was a little longer on top but the rain fly is good. Easy to use and seems like it will last a long time. It's not terribly comfy to have 26lbs on your back anyway but at least I can get out & walk the dog too with the babe for about 30min or so. And im 5'6 and 120lbs.",4,1
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red",This product was given as a baby shower gift.  The new parents were very appreciative and love the product.  I was very pleased with the price and the delivery time since I went through Amazon to another company to purchase.  I ordered it on a Monday afternoon and had it be Wednesday afternoon and was able to wrap the item instead of a picture for the shower on Thursday.  Recommend highly.,5,1
Britax Preview Stroller Onyx,"We got this stroller with the car seat.  I agree that if you think you are going to drive this with one hand, you are crazed.  However, I love this car seat because my son, who is now 30 months, can comfortably sleep in it still, rolling over and stretched out even at 38+"".  The key to the sleeping at toddler age is the kick out at the bottom.  No others really have that, especially for the price.  We also have a combi and it is far narrower and he sleeps much worse in it.  It is however highly manuverable if that is what you want.  The Britax also flods unbelievably narrow (but long).  I can fit it and tons of stuff in my Jetta truck.",4,1
Chicco Polly Highchair Pacifica,"This is such a versatile chair - love the way you can fold it down compactly, yet it's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used.The tray stores on the back legs when not in use - nice touch.For the reviewer who complained that the ""thing that separates the legs"" is attached to the tray - you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray...  Plus it's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up.My 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray - terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime.",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"This monitor does the job.  It's small and portable:  I brought it on a recent 1 week vacation and it's so compact.  The reception is fine, the picture is clear, and the battery lasts forever.  When you don't have it plugged in the picture turns itself off every few minutes but you still hear the sound and are able to get the picture back with the push of the top button.  I guess it saves the battery life.  You can hear fuzz and interference if it's too close to other electronic devices but that hasn't been a problem.  It also works in conjunction with other summer infant monitors (at least the other one I have) so I now have it set up for 2 rooms.  You can't beat it or the price.  I bought mine from babyplayroom and it arrived in a timely manner and their customer service was great.  We also did a lot of research first until we came across this one.Hope this helps.",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We love this monitor!  The ability to take unplug it and carry it around during the day when our little girl is sleeping is wonderful, and then at night we just recharge it while we have it on next to the bed.  There can be interference when plugged in near a phone (only sometimes).",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We had a Summer video monitor already (not handheld) so I knew what to expect with picture quality (very good) and static (lots of it).  I needed a handheld so I could take my toddler outside while the baby slept.  We've been pleased with the monitor so far, but the battery died in under two months and I had to keep it plugged into the A/C adaptor to use it.  I managed battery life just as they directed, using it unplugged during the day and charging it overnight.  And still the battery pooped out so quickly.Thankfully Summer did mail me a replacement battery for free and we are back in business.  They were helpful and prompt with a simple inquiry over the website.  It's just so dissapointing that children's items like this are of such marginal quality at such a high price.  I find this to be true of many things sold to parents who will pay any amount to give us peace of mind with our kids.  But off my soapbox....Oh and one little tidbit...we were able to use it in combination with our existing Summer camera to have one channel on our son's room and one channel on our daughters.  That was a nice surprise.All in all, a decent monitor for the price when compared to what's out there.  Not sure I'd want to pay more for more features.",4,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I bought this monitor and an extra camera because we have a 18 month old and a new born coming.  (I write this from the delivery room!) But our 18 month old was in a toddler bed but was sleeping anywhere but the bed, so we wanted to know what he was doing and that he was safe.  I couldn't ask for a better camera.  There are cheaper ones and more expensive ones.  I can't really get the color option, but I don't really need it.  Also, being able to hook this up to a bigger TV is AWESOME!  My wife just hooks it to our TV in the bedroom and we have no problem seeing our toddler.  With two cameras this works wonderfully. Nightvision is very clear with just a nightlight.  We have four portible phones, wireless internet, and other devices and we have had little to no interference.  This was a great purchase for less than 200 bucks.  Something that we can use in a ton of different ways.  We love this!",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,Great image and sound quality. Also hooked the monitor up to my large screen TV and was able to switch and watch the baby on the TV with great video quality and sound.,5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I bought this monitor and even though my baby will still arrive in July, I have already tested a lot and it works just fine! It films even without any lights at all! I think I would be worried about leaving my baby sleeping by herself (my first!) but now I feel more secure as I don't need to go to her room all the time to check on her.Baby monitor without video are worthless, in my opinion! If the baby is right in the border of your bed - for example - it won't make any different sound until he falls. But with the video you can see and save him before the accident happen!",5,1

Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"I love this camera.  I have not had any problems with it due to interference from phones or internet.  The range is good --I can go outside or downstairs and it still works.  At night, the image is a bit dark-but still good enough to see whether or not the baby is sleeping or not.I don't have any complaints, and this product made the transition of my daughter into her own room much easier on me!Also, I was able to get this at a great price on Amazon.  The price fluctuated quite a bit, so by checking frequently I got a great deal!!",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"This video monitor works awesome.  We have an acre of property and I'm able to walk all around it and still get crystal clear reception of baby sleeping in his crib.  The reason this is a must have for me is when I hear noise coming from his room in the middle of the night, I don't have to get up and out of bed; I can see from the nightstand if he's truly awake or just making noise and I can go right back to sleep. The compact size makes it easy to transport around the house/property with no additional plugging in, batteries, etc. necessary.",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"This video monitor is a must have for parents.  The fact that you have video both day and night is great.  The only negatives to this monitor would be it's durability and battery life.  The battery starts good, but it starts holding less and less a charge, to the point where I had to keep it plugged in all the time.  As for the durability, I had dropped it and banged it around a bit, so the wear on it took it's toll.  I wish it held up a little bit better.  Overall, this is a great product, though.",4,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We've been using this video monitor for our newborn for almost 6 weeks now.  It is indispensable. The battery life is surprisingly good.  Since our baby only sleeps for at most 3 hours, we have never run low on battery.  The fact that it is analog (not digital) is a big advantage.  Whenever there is interference (from cell phone, microwave, etc.), the picture and sound are mildly degraded rather than being lost altogether.  The range is quite good -- we have used it up to 100 feet through several walls with no problem.  The microphone is very sensitive which is great.  If I listen carefully I can hear our baby breathing (our house is pretty quiet -- in a noisier location it might not be possible).  Although the display is quite small (1.8 inches) the picture is very sharp.  Even though we placed the camera about 4 feet from the baby, we can still see if his eyes are opened or closed.  We're very happy with this purchase.",5,1

Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We bought this before our second child was born 18 months ago.  We use it EVERY night.  We also travel with it often and it is easy to set up, the picture is perfect on it still 18 months later.  My 5 year old sleeps in the same room by choice so even if we are not checking on the baby and we hear her need something or have a bad dream we can check on her.  We don't stare at it like we used to, but it is comforting to know we can always check on them without going upstairs and opening doors.  We can also see if our youngest has wet through her diaper on this, which is nice because we are able to change her in her sleep so she is not like that all night.  We absolutely LOVE this monitor, it is a must have for all parents.",5,1

I love that the parent monitor plugs in or is battery operated so that you can carry it around.  The camera comes with a long cord that allows you plenty of options in positioning it.  The sound is SUPER SENSITIVE.  I turn it all the way up and I can hear the baby breathing or moving around.  I would definitely recommend this unit.",5,1

Tigger Teether Blanket,"My 3 month old son is beginning to teethe, his is not old enough (does not have enough motor control) to coordinate a bigger/heavier typical teething ring or toy.  He actually has the winnie-the-pooh teething blanket (which I can't find ANYWHERE, but is identical except for the head), but it is wonderful.  The blanket allows for a lot of sensory exploration (with the crinkle corner), allows him to work on manipulation of the entire blanket, and allows him to have something in his mouth (which is key with him right now)... I had to order the tigger blanket so that I can leave one at his day care and also have one home.  IT'S GREAT!!!",5,1
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"I'm extremely happy with this scale.  I received it on time and in perfect condition.  I only wish I had known about sooner!  A few years ago, my veterinarian suggested I get a baby scale to monitor my sick cat Randy's weight, but they were very expensive.  This year, again, it was suggested to get a scale for my kitty, Peaches to save going back and forth to the vet.  After a lot of research, I found this baby pet scale and it's exactly what I needed.  It's sturdy and accurate.  Since cats tend to move there is a hold button to lock the weight as soon as it registers.  Though I've only used it for my kitty so far, it's nice to know I can use it to weigh mail if needed!!  Excellent product at a great price!",5,1
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"Having a newborn baby right around the time of the flu and rsv season is pretty scary.  I found that taking her to the pediatrician full of sick kids and germs to get weighed every week, was just too risky.  I purchased this digital scale and I love it.  In fact, it is better than the scales they have at the pediatrician's office!  I personally like the fact that it is battery operated, the &#34;hold&#34; button works great for squirmy babies and it is very accurate.  Having tracked our baby's weight daily in the NICU, this scale is very comparable to what we are used to.  I weigh her everyday and track it in grams (+50g or -10g etc) and in lbs oz.  I love that you can easily toggle between, grams, kilograms, lbs, etc. It's a fun trick to guess her kilograms exactly at her various doctors offices before they put her on the scale!I highly recommend this scale if you have a baby and you need to monitor weight gain accurately/consistantly.  I'm considering buying another one to donate to the pediatrician's office...",5,1
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"Easy to setup and use.  Stable, repeatable readings. Recommend for anyone who wants to insure they aren't overfeeding or underfeeding their pets.",4,1
4 In 1 Convertible Bassinet - Porter,"I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 due some features being less than desirable.  The matress pad is a cheap flimsy pad and it bunches up with regular bassinet sheets.  The mattress is supported by a very sturdy board underneath so I wasn't concerned with the stability regarding her back support.  Also the features last about 10 - 15 minutes... then they shut off.  It would be rather nice to have them stay on for about 30 minutes or so until the baby is actually asleep.  I find myself getting up again to put the vibration feature on another few cycles.  When I received it and took it out of the packaging - it smelled like it had been in a warehouse with rotting things.  I had to cold wash it with regular detergent, and tumble dry it slightly to the point where it would air dry the rest.  Without doing that - regular air dry out of the package wasn't doing anything for the stench.  It literally overwhelmed my room with the odor.  Word to the wise - Give yourself a good afternoon to put this together.  It took me 2.5 hours to assemble, and following the directions was not that difficult.  Some of the items for assembly are attached to separate parts, so unpack and detatch all the parts before assuming they aren't there.  Other than that, it's excellent.My newborn is two and a half weeks old now and she really likes the music and the vibration feature.  The vibration sometimes help soothe her to sleep when she is extra fussy.  With the combination of the mobile, lights, vibration and music - its enough to keep her satisfied for a few minutes while I do my makeup, etc.  I was going to use the co sleeper while I was healing from the C-Section, but didn't end up needing to with my husband helping out.  That feature was also a bonus too though.I bought this on a whim because I had only seen slightly negative comments re: the lack of being able to wash appropriately (with another color *white*) and also another negative comment on the mattress.  I did, however, do TONS of research on models that had several features and were small enough to fit in our tight spaced city bedroom.  This was one of the only ones that fits fine, and definitely does the trick for the cost.  The mobile causes me a bit of concern since it does hang lower than other mobiles I have seen into the bed area... but they do recommend removing it when the baby gets mobile enough to reach and grab.  I'll be sure to remove it when she starts getting a little more aggresive.All in all - it's worth the purchase.  It's not too pricey, and it has a lot of gadgets that will entertain your little one.  Especially since this is only used for 3 months, I would suggest getting this one... even with the little negatives.  :)",4,1
4 In 1 Convertible Bassinet - Porter,"I bought the bassinet for my stepdaughter, so I haven't actually tried it out, but she demonstrated all the features to me and I thought it was great!I was impressed with the pattern/material that it was made with, it was very elegant looking, but neutral enough to be used for a boy or girl.As my step-grandchild was just born last week and we don't live in the same town, I haven't visited the baby at home yet, only the hospital, so that's all I can say about it.",5,1
"Gund Baby Spunky Plush Puppy Toy Small, Blue",This puppy is such a cute little stuffed buddy for a baby!It makes a cute little room decoration or addition to a baby gift.,5,1
Trend High Chair - Malawi,"overall, this highchair is pretty good.  The extra fabric seat worked well and also positioned her better in the chair.  (She is small and the extra padding allowed her to see over the top of the chair.)  I also liked the extra tray.  It's nice to have a clean tray while one is in the dishwasher. The only problem that i had with it the first time that i washed the padded seat, the seam on the top split open a little. (I washed it on delicate too.)",4,1
Travel System - Malawi,"I bought this system not only because I used the Malawi theme for my sons nursery, but I also liked it's features. The car seat has a 5-point harness which is hard to do at first, but it's very secure and it's a breeze to get him in and out of it once we got used to it. You do have to be careful when collapsing the stroller because the tray on the front will bang into the ground if you're not paying attention. All in all the stroller is very sturdy.",4,1
Lambs &amp; Ivy Froggy Tales Decorative Pillow,"I have purchased the entire Froggy Tales line and absolutely love it.  Each time I went to the store, they were out of the pillow so I ordered it online.  I was a little disappointed when it arrived.  It is much smaller than I imagined.  The dimensions say it is 14 inches by 16 inches and there is no way that it is.  It is more like 8 x 8.  I will keep it because it does match the set, but I wish it was a little larger.",4,1
Kolcraft Baby Sit &amp; Step&reg; 2-In-1 Activity Center,Fairly easy to assemble and our 6 month old loves it. Extra nice in that it's an activity center and walker in one so that you don't have two pieces of large baby equipment cluttering the house.One mystery is why Kolcraft ships the product with the latch clips already installed as sometimes these can get broken in shipping and you'll have to order a whole new tray (they provide replacement for free)but it seems like shipping with them not attached would make more sense but I guess that's why I'm not CEO of Kolcraft????,4,1
Kolcraft Baby Sit &amp; Step&reg; 2-In-1 Activity Center,"My wife and I were accidentally introduced to the Kolcraft when we stopped by a friend's house with our (then) 3.5 month old son. They had one, and when we put our son into it he literally squealed with delight and giggled like we had never previously heard him. I shopped the 'net and decided, as is almost always the case, to buy from Amazon. No regrets at all with the purchase. Our son is now 5.5 months old and spends lots of very happy playtime in the Kolcraft. It is well constructed and lots of fun for him. I ENTHUSIASTICALLY recommend this product and Amazon to all parents in the market.",5,1
Graco Duo Glider LXI Double Stroller in Metropolitan,"When we were originally looking to purchase a double stroller, we had debated on a side-by-side or a tandem.  After all the pain-in-the-[...] stories we heard about side-by-sides being to wide to fit thru some doorways and how difficult it could be to get thru a childrens clothing store, we decided to get a tandem and we are SO VERY HAPPY that we did!!  We have a newborn and a 2 1/2 yr old and this stroller is fantastic!  There is plenty of room for both kids (I personally prefer the 2 1/2 yr old in the front seat and the infant carrier in the back seat for the baby).  There is plenty of room for a diaper bag under the back seat, even when the back seat is being used with the infant carrier.  Some people argue that this stroller is a little heavy, but for what you get out of it, you don't even notice (it's honestly not much heavier than any other double stroller, and it's even lighter than some).  I have a van and I have no problems handling the stroller in and out of my van.  It was very simple to assemble when I purchased it.  It is also very easy to open and close (you can easily do it with one hand), parts don't fall off and it is really not all that difficult to get used to pushing around.  It is obviously longer than a traditional single stroller, so really all you have to do is get used to the fact that it is just a little longer.  I like that you can remove the trays from the front and back seat if you do not want them.  The front umbrella shade is also very easily removable.  I was also very happy that it accomodated my Snugride infant carrier/carseat that I purchased with a different single seat Graco stroller that I had for my first born.  It was nice not to have to buy another infant carrier and another base for my car.  My friend has children ages 4, 3, 2, 1 and she's pregnant with her fifth ~ this stroller has been a lifesaver for her too!  We highly recommend it!!",5,1

"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","Love the large quantity of bags for an affordable price.  I bought these for a vacation so I could easily and cleanly dispose of diapers in our hotel room.  The bags worked great for their purpose and contained any smells.  It was a more affordble option than the diaper sacks I usually carry in my diaper bag (munchkin arm and hammer).  They worked great in our hotel room, however, I probably won't be using these as my go to diaper sack.  The munchkin arm and hammer bags come on a roll with a dispenser, which works better for me.",4,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",For some reason all of the stores stopped carrying this product so I ordered from your company and have been for some time.  My wife and I both has medical problems that require these sacks.  We are very happy with them.,5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I rated these 5 stars because they are perfect! I run a daycare and i got tired of buying diaper jeanie refills that adds up! and also cleaning that stinky covered diaper pail got old! These bags are so nice just grab one, they pop up like wipes, tie the bag shut and toss in the normal trash can! They have a clean smell to them and work even for the smelliest of diapers!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","WOW. Finally a solution to smelly diapers. Diaper pails are essentially useless once your kids start eating solids, even if you buy the expensive diaper genie bags. This is such a simple, yet useful product that does the job great - and at such an cheap price it's an even better value. I like the fact that you can take these on the go with you as well.",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I love the idea of diaper sacks, and this one is very good, the scent is just enough to mask the contents ;-) Better than the ones you get at Babies 'R Us. Buy the biggest count you can find!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","We absolutely LOVE these. I have 6 kids and have used them consistently. Right now I have a 2 1/2 y/o (lol yes we are potty training but with a new sibling you know how that is going!) and a 4 month old so these are great. They are perfect sized for a BIG mess or for 2-4 smaller messes and with the tie handles you can close and open as needed. Also we use them for messed clothes whether it be from diaper explosions or just down right dirty. We even use them for older kids clothes (shirts, socks, undies, bathing suits...a pair of my older kids pants wouldn't fit but the rest does, and I'm talking older like 10, 11 and 17!) These are great for sooo many things I don't have the time or space to list them all and for every one I can tell you I'm sure someone else can think of 5 more :-)So I'm going to give a few of you a very simple and logical answers to a two of your problems1) The smell is too strong.Ok. So I can't completely disagree with this BUT of course when something is scented and is contained the smell is going to be stronger when you first open it and keep it in the same packaging. I have a quart sized Ziploc type bag in the diaper bag and that makes them portable and the smell isn't as strong but still you smell the scent not the poop (WHICH just a IMO, these work so great and even when the scent is really faded I would still rate these better then the others I have tried because they really keep the scent in and the scent of the bag I think is more for parents to think it makes it work better)Also for those of us that use them at home I put the in a used wipes box and feed them through this helps lessen the smell AND bring me two the 2nd problem some people have had trouble with2) The are hard to use (get out of box)So I have a solution for this... when I get a new box I open it completely and then separate it in thirds. Don't separate the bags  just put them in a empty pop up wipes box then carefully feed one through the pop up area and then gently pull up and use, the others will follow as long as you don't yank them out too hard or pull too fast. Easy, simple and you are re-purposing something :-)",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I use these for stinky diapers at home, and all diapers on the run.  They have a stronger baby-powder smell than the BabiesRUs brand ones do, so I find them more effective at hiding odors.  The bags do not dispense from the box very well, and that is annoying, but they do what they are supposed to do.",4,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","Very good product to have. Got this one before baby arrived. Well needed. and last a while. I only use for doody diapers. When out, use for soiled garments. keeps smell in very well. Good price.",5,1

"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",This Baggie works very well on soiled diapers.  So easy to dispose of. Can also be used  to dispose colostomy bags,5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","These are a good price and so easy to use!  They smell like baby powder, kinda strong, which is good to combat diaper odors!  Highly recommend!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","These are ALL you need. The rule in the house is peepee diapers can go right in the trash can, poopoo diapers go in one of these first. The scent is pretty strong, but consider what it's trying to mask... We have these everywhere! In her diaper bag, in her changing table, in the living room (where the majority of her diapers get changed). All of my friends that are new moms give up on the diaper genie within 30 days and just switch over to this. So much easier, cheaper, and nothing can break! I throw a poopy diaper in one of these when i'm at a friend house who doesn't have kids and just put it in my diaper bag to throw away at our house. I feel too guilty making someone else deal with baby poo who doesn't have their own!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I really like the product, I just wish that it would be offered as a subscription items as it is a natural complement to diaper orders.I like the size, the quality/thickness, the shape (easy to close) and the perfume used.I recommend this product.",4,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I fought a long battle with our pup's stinky pee-pads befouling the wastebasket -- then I reconceptualized the pads as, basically, Floor Diapers. I found these great little bags and the problem is solved! Sassy Baby = no more Stinky Puppy!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",These sacks are great! I use them in the baby's room and also have them in the diaper bag to use on the go. They have a very pleasant powder scent.,5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I use these bags for picking up my dog poop when I'm out walking my two dogs, I love the fact they keep my bag smelling nice, and even once Ive picked up the poop they smell reasonably nice until I can find a trash can.Great price too",5,1

EddieBauer Alpha Omega Dlx 3in1 Car Seat,"We purchased this seat when our then 6-month old grew out of her Graco SnugRide.  The one problem we had with it is getting the rear-facing recline right.  There are lines on the side of the seat that you need to level with the ground (we have a little tiny level that we carry around with the carseat when we move it to different cars), and had a terrible time getting it reclined far enough in our good-sized SUV.  Our solution: removing the base.  Between taking out the base and putting a rolled towel under the front of the seat, we got the recline angle right and were able to fit it in the middle back seat between the two front seats.  My daughter loves the roominess of the seat, and I love that her head no longer flops forward when she falls asleep.",4,1
So Close Crib Monitor,"I think this monitor is extremely well-designed and worth every penny. It works best within the recommended range (1,000 ft.) so it probably won't work for people with ginormous homes who want to be floors away from their babies! It worked really well for us- I used my monitor every.single.day to take a quick shower while my wee one took his mid-morning nap in the Arms Reach Co-sleeper. I never noticed a problem with static at all- but if I had, I would have just taken it back for an exchange/refund. We now have the multi-unit Safety 1st monitor with different colored bases in every room and love the ""walkie talkies"" but that's another review! Someone else said in their review that Fisher-Price monitors are great but my experience has been that they end up being nothing more than ""flashlights"" for a toddler to play with! To each parent their own monitor I suppose. Good luck finding one that works for you and remember: no monitor can take the place of a parents loving and watchful presence!",4,1
Carters Raised Dot Textured Blanket - Yellow,"I received two of these blankets for a baby shower and am in love with them.  This blanket is so soft on one side and silky smooth on the other, plus, I love the vintage look they have.  They have been machine washed several time and still look fantastic.  Great buy.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Flannel, Small, Pink Gingham",Both of my babies loved to be swaddled and this was the only thing they could not get out of. A must have for sure!,5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Flannel, Small, Pink Gingham","I absolutely love the Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe line. Although if you're looking for something light weight, I would just stick to the 100% cotton vs the flannel. The flannel is a bit stiff and doesn't stretch as much or feel as soft as the regular cotton SwaddleMe.",4,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"I bought the new Ocean Wonders Aquarium for my son's crib.  He is just 2 months old and enjoys his aquarium so much!  It helps him sleep and stay sleeping for extended periods of time.  Not sure what the problem is from some of the other reviewers but the motor is not loud at all, especially considering how it helps my son sleep!  Fisher-Price has done it again!!  Great item!",5,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"I can understand why they attempted to make the batteries easier to access, but really it doesn't buy much by having the pack on the outside of the crib. Installing it was much more complicated than the earlier version (although still manageable). This toy never made it to my 9 month old's crib because my 3 year old snagged it and likes to play with it (he had one when he was very young, but I didn't think he'd remember it, I guess he did!). It stands up by itself on the side of his twin bed up against the wall because of the new battery pack, so I guess that's a benefit?The movement of the fish seems louder than the previous version, but not too loud. The light on this one is not too bright or dim. All in all, its good, I liked the original version better though :)",4,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"My 5 month old daughter and I love the Ocean Wonders Aquarium.  From the moment I press the button, she's hypnotized by the music and movements.  The only downside is that it doesn't have a repeat setting for those nights when  my daughter fights falling asleep.",4,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,I received this as a shower gift and put it on my daughters crib. Ever since she was born she has been using this. I love the way it lights up and plays different music and bubble sounds. She is 1 now and still plays with it. She turns it on and off and makes the little things move. Sometimes my husband and I hear it in the middle of the night on her monitor. The music makes her go right back to sleep. When she turns it on in the morning it keeps her busy until we get her milk ready and come to get her. A very good crib toy to have !!!,5,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,My daughter loves this toy!!!!!! the movement of the fish keep her enthralled along w/ the music....,5,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,I like the way this attached so easily to the crib. It's a convertible crib and I never found a hanging mobile that fit. My son loves to play with it first thing in the morning and have it lull him to sleep at night. He likes the light on it also. My advice is to play the music/sounds on low and not use the movement button at night. It's pretty noisy.,4,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"I believe for $11.99, this toy is a good value, although I would not pay much more for it.  To keep the battery pack attached to the toy, you have to tighten the four small screws inside the battery compartment to the toy before inserting the batteries.  Now, whether this is acceptable to you or not, that's a different issue.  I personally don't mind since it isn't something I'm doing once a week or even once a month.The one I received wasn't producing any bubbles.  I'm presuming the pump that produces bubbles is either defective or just too weak.My daughter is 19 months is still enjoys it.  She likes watching the fishgo around and she has fun turning on and off the music.  I also had the earlier version, which she also enjoyed, but I can't say with any amount of certainty which one is better.",4,1
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"My daughter loves this toy.  I wake up in the morning and hear the toy playing.  She used to wake up crying for me, but now goes right to the toy!",5,1
Fisher-Price: Elmo's Musical Sing and Teach Gym,"I had this with my first two children and then had to track it down when the third one came.  It's an awesome gym.

Lambs &amp; Ivy Dream Teddy Lamp with Shade and Nightlight,"Excellent lamp, with the smaller light just what is necessary to change diaper at night without waking the baby up. Great idea to buy it, I stongly recommend. The only small minus is the switch that is a little noisy, but it is fine.",5,1

Jaz O Shades Sunglasses Pink for Children 4 to 8 Years Old.,"These sunglasses work well.  They're adjustable and come with two straps - on for infants and one for toddlers.  My 10-month old is on the big side of the infant strap now.  They don't seem to pinch his nose.  The strap is snug enough that it doesn't move around or come loose during normal wear, but my son can pull them down when he wants to (which he does except when it's really bright outside).  Would definitely buy again.",4,1
Svan Svan High Chair Cushion - Sage,Well worth the investment!  Both piece come off and on easily. AND they can both go into the washer and dryer for even easier cleaning.  The cover is by far easier to clean than the wood of the chair.,5,1
Twinkle Twinkle - 4-Piece Bedding Set,"Once I decided on moons and stars for my infants room, I went in search of a bedding set to go with it. I found this one and fell in love with it!! The quilt is beautiful and very soft. The appliques are very well applied so there is no chance of a little one pulling them off. I got the set plus the wooden wall hanging and it looks adorable!! I am saving the dust ruffle for when my son moves to his toddler bed. My only complaint is the fitted sheet that came with it seemed to get brittle in the wash. It got a rip on on of the corners after a few months of use. This is a great set for a boy or a girl.",4,1
Reebok Velocity Extreme Jogging Stroller,I jog with my little one almost 25 miles a week. Love the shocks. The rain guard is the best for rain and also wind-chill when the weather is cool. The moveable sun guard can't be beat when you are constantly changing directions. Surprised this is off the market. Also the rubber hand grip is the best and doest soak up the sweat or crack and tear like the others. The rear tires last about 400 miles on road but easy enough to replace when ordered on line. Thank you Rebock!,5,1
Reebok Velocity Extreme Jogging Stroller,"I'm an avid runner so when we knew we were having a family my task was to find a jogging stroller.  After reviewing all type for months on the internet I finally went with the Reebok.  I was able to start running with my daughter when she was three months old because the Reebok was one of the only strollers that could recline.  It has a front zip on pocket that catches any toys that are dropped instead of them falling on to the road and it also acts as protection against the sun in the summer and the cold of the winter.  It's nice and compact in the seating area so when out running in the winter with the plastic cover on (included with the stroller), heat loss is minimal.Yes it did pull to one side but it doesn't take a `rocket scientist' to realize how to correct the problem with out reading the instructions.  I'm not a big muscular person and I find it easy to run while controlling the stroller with one hand.I've now had the Reebok for just over a year, I run 3 - 4 times a week with my daughter and I'm about to pass the 2000km mark using it for running only, not including any walks we do with it.  I've never had a deflated tire or a bent frame...I don't know what one does to bend the frame!!Would and have recommended the Reebok, great jogging stroller.",5,1

Peg Perego Duette Twin Stroller - Toffee,"I've really enjoyed my Duette... sure it's heavier than others, but it's more stable that anything else I've looked at... and BELIEVE ME I shopped around!!  Like the other mom said, if you're a whimp or you have a tiny car don't buy it and then whine about it all over the internet.  This is a very versatile stroller that's also gorgeous.  And when it comes to having a steering wheel... you can't get any better!  I've read so many reviews about front to back doubles that are ridiculously hard to steer.  Anyway, I love it!",5,1
Disney Princess Storage Table and Chairs,It looks nice in my daughter room everything matches.,4,1
Delta Children's Products Haven Changing Table in Cherry,"I guess you can say my review will be a little unfinshed becuase the baby isn't due till June, but i purchased this for $20 dollars less at baby depot and by husband put it together in 15 mins. The quility is great, the table is sturdy and matches my other cherry wood furniture, that is not made by the same manufactor. The table is great, hopefully i think this highly of it after it is used a few dozen times..",5,1
"Tuffo Water-Resistant Outdoor Blanket, Navy Plaid",Use it at the kids soccer and baseball games. Great carrying case and the water resistance works well. Used it for picnics as well.,5,1
"Tuffo Water-Resistant Outdoor Blanket, Navy Plaid",I love this blanket.  It is perfect for indoors and outdoors.  It is just big enough for about two adults and a child.  It is great because if you spill something on it all you have to do is wipe it off.  It comes with a carrying case.  The blanket folds easily and is easy to store. I highly recommend it!,5,1
"Kiddopotamus Rayshade UV Protective Double Stroller Shade for Twin Strollers &amp; Joggers, Navy","This shade offers far more extensive sun shading than the typical shades on strollers.  My only complaint was there were no instructions to help attach it correctly.  Fortunately, it's not the kind of thing that requires a Mensa membership to figure out.  ; ).  This has been a fantastic addition for keeping my little ones more comfortable.",4,1
"Tadpoles Classics Gingham Crib Bumper, Blue","Pretty and nice width.  The ties were a bit problematic for use in a IKEA crib, but still usable.  Didn't line up perfectly because the IKEA crib did not have slats all around.  Probably fine in a ""normal"" crib.  The product quality and appearance were very nice.",4,1
"Tadpoles Classics Gingham Crib Bumper, Blue",This product is great! It does everything I wanted it to and looks great as well. It was easy to install and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a great inexpensive crib bumper!!!,5,1
Tadpoles Basics Diaper Stacker - Pink,Came quickly in the mail and in great condition.  Looks really nice in person.,5,1
BR Zoophabet Calender,This calendar is very easy to use and I like all of the stickers and spaces to write. Hopefully it will make a nice keepsake for my son one day!,5,1
"Snoozy Organic Cotton Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad Featuring Safety Stay on Corners, 28&quot;x 52&quot;","It fits our daughter's crib mattress great, and adds that little bit of padding I'd like her to sleep on now that she's over a year old. It also works well for our Graco pack-n-play when folded in half, the excess folded under the ends, and a crib sheet on top.",5,1
"Snoozy Organic Cotton Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad Featuring Safety Stay on Corners, 28&quot;x 52&quot;","its nice and soft, washes well. i recommend to anybody looking for a waterproof crib mattress pad. i wish they would come in different colors :)",5,1
Leachco Natural Boost - Adjustable Nursing Pillow - Denim,"I've used the Boppy and the BrestFriend, but this pillow beats them all.  It's wide enough to ensure your baby doesn't slide off, which was my problem w/ the Boppy, and it adjustable pillow makes a perfect angle for your baby's head as he/she nurses.  It's especially nice that you don't have to fumble around trying to strap on the pillow, as you would w/ the BrestFriend -- something which was NOT pleasant to do with those middle of the night feedings.I've also washed this pillow several times.  Yes, it will flatten out w/ washings, but you can spot clean, which is what the manufacturer recommends.  Even if it does flatten out, it's so reasonably priced that you may as well buy another.",5,1
"Chinese Prefold Diaper: White, Small (up to 15 lbs)","This is a great choice for a pre-fold.  We used them a lot to cloth diaper my baby when she was tiny, and now that she has grown out of them we are using them as burp cloths.  However, I plan to use them for my next baby too.Pre-folds have a little bit of a learning curve-- more so than other types of cloth diapers-- but you can't beat the price and I think they work great.  However, if you have a hesitant cloth diaperer around, this is probably not the diaper to give them-- it can be a little clumsy and there is more room for error.  In larger sizes we are switching mostly to pockets because they are more user-friendly and for the sake of having a more streamlined diaper stash.  However, if I was the sole diaperer we would probably continue to use some of these!",4,1
"Chinese Prefold Diaper: White, Medium (15-30 lbs)","I decided to start cloth diapering my two boys this past year. I got 15 of this size and 15 of the infant size. They are still holding up great! Even though some days I have to do laundry every day! They wash well, are super absorbent and the stains come right out when hung in the sun! Great purchase! I definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to CD!",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 12 Pack,"These out let plugs work good. They are easy to get in. They can be a little tough to get out, but I kind of like that since it means it is harder for the child to get out. Great deal for the price.",5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","I  very happy that I purchased these for all the outlets in our home. They fit perfectly on all our outlets and don't even look that bad. I also haven't had any issues with plugging in items. They take a little work to open which is exactly what I want to prevent my daughter from accessing the outlet. What I love the most is not having to deal with the individual outlet covers--pulling them out to use the outlet, putting them in a place where my daughter can't reach them and then remembering to plug them back in. Additionally, if my daughter pulls out a cord that's plugged in, the covers automatically slide shut. In my opinion, they are definitely the best option for child proofing outlets.",5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","I have a one year old that feels the need to touch outlets. Now, I don't have to worry. If she pulls a plug out, it immediately closes. Will be putting more of these around!",5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",Love Love Love these!  We can protect our little one and still use the outlets.  These are good for the outlets you still need to use.  Bonus:  our plugs were loose in the outlets before this.  These covers took care of that problem too.  A++,5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",Great product easy to install. This matches my walls better than the old plates new color is Favorite Tan from Sherwin Williams,5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",I've installed about a dozen of these throughout my house and am impressed with the quality.  They don't stand out and they are much easier to use (plug something in) when necessary versus the standard plastic babyproofing plugs which can also pose a choking hazard.  So far my little one has shown little interest in these and hopefully it will stay that way.  Careful when screwing in the plate as the screw head is made of very soft metal and strips easily (the paint chips even easier than that!).  I definitely recommend these over plugs if you have the budget.,5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","I got these outlet covers for outlets that I would need to use more frequently.  The installation was very straightforward.  You just need to unscrew your old ones and screw these on.  They covered the area of my outlet the same way the old ones did, which is great considering we have painted walls and I didn't want to have to touch up unpainted spots.  The screw is in the center, so if you have an older outlet these won't work.  They openings are easy to slide over and stick the plugs in, and they snap back to cover the outlet quickly and effectively.  Whoever came up with these is a genius!  So far no complaints, but if something comes up I will update this review.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,My mother in law bought me some expensive outlet plugs to prevent my (at the time) 1 year old from messing with the outlets. Before she hit 2 we caught her taking all those outlet plugs out of the outlets. So when my 6 month old started crawling I decided to try out these reasonable Mommy's Helper outlet plugs. And they are wonderful! My now 3 year old can not take them out of the outlets. Which reassures me that my 6 month old will most definitely not be able to take them out!,5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,Got these to help with cold air in the winter. Definitely keeps the cold wind from blowing through the house. Helped our heating bill go down.,5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"These are REALLY DIFFICULT to get out of an outlet, even with sturdy adult fingernails.  That is what I wanted when I bought them!",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,What can I say about these?  They were cheap (cost-wise) and they do the trick.  We've put them in all the outlets here and now no longer worry about little fingers finding their way into the sockets!,5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"These do a very good job, they are also a bit cheaper than many other brands out there.  They exactly what they claim to be.  But I will say they do an excellent job.Our child has never been able to remove one of them and to be honest I don't expect she will anytime soon, as they are kind of a pain for us to remove.  In truth if I have cut my fingernails recently they are almost too hard for me to remove.  Which in my opinion is probably a good thing for keeping little fingers out of outlets.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"OK for the money, I have eight months old baby girl, so it a must buy.",4,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"We bought these outlet covers to keep our puppy from chewing electrical cords.  She's nearly 3 years old and had never done any cord chewing in the past, but one time is all that's needed.  We put the outlet covers in any outlets around her areas (bed, crate, etc) and there haven't been any problems since.  The 36-pack is helpful so you can use them in many outlets that aren't being used.  Great product that works exactly as expected, price is good, delivery was fast and easy.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,I bought this for my son when he started crawling. This is ideal for the safety of toddlers. GREAT price too!,5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"These outlet covers are workhorses in the baby safety game.  We recently moved from an old house where they were a lot looser in the ancient plugs - but my 14 month old still couldn't pull them out.  And now that we're in a newer house, they are so tight that it's difficult for me to get them out sometimes.  But I'm fine with that - I have no problem enduring a little inconvenience to make sure she's safe.  The good news is that after a while, she started ignoring plugs because she knows she can't get into them.  Even at non-baby-proofed houses, plugs aren't as attractive as they once were.  So these double as a training aid as well as a deterrent - I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"These do their job. They are a little difficult to pull out of the socket when you need to use it, but that's the point. :)",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,This product is exactly what I expected.  The value was great.  They do exactly the job they were meant to.,5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"When my son started licking electric outlets, I knew it was time to baby proof!  These work very well.  I have caught my son playing with the electric outlets and fingering the covers, but he can't get them off (thank goodness!).  The good news is, with a little tugging, I can get 'em off for vacuuming and such.  Solid product, good price!",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"Helpful and simple.  The kid can't stick things like fingers and utensils into the socket, your stress goes down.  These aren't the fancy protectors that do anything else but prevent them from accessing the 110 volts of danger lurking every few feet in your home.  But that's all I really needed.  Plus, they were a great price compared to what most stores are asking for.  Arrived quickly and I was able to cover my entire house with just a couple packages.Only thing of note would be that when sockets were really close together, such as with a wall mounted surge protector, the protectors were a bit too wide to place them side by side.  Not really the fault of the protectors though.  A quick workaround was layering them on top of each other.  For example, in a row of three, put the right and left one first, then the middle.  You get the idea.  Worked just fine.  Yay safety!",5,1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"For the price, you really can't complain. And yes, it is hard to take off once you plug it in the socket but at least this means your baby won't be able to take it out either!",4,1
Kel Gar Tubbly Elephant Bubble Bath Dispenser,"I love the way it looks , like many other I had to take a drill to it to fit over the shower pop up but it's worth and only took 10min if your handy",5,1
Kel Gar Tubbly Elephant Bubble Bath Dispenser,My kids have bumped their heads on the metal spout plenty of times. Once my daughter even stood up right next to it and scratched her back right near her spine. I felt so bad and couldn't wait to buy some type of faucet protector. I am so glad I saw and bought this one. My kids love it and I have no regrets of buying it. Was a little nervous at first reading the reviews but it fit our spout perfectly (we have the spout without the shower divider),5,1
Primo Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) (White),"I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,"I'm very happy with the seat. My son has been using it for a few months now (ever since we potty-trained him). It fit well on a regular-sized toilet seat and is soft and comfy, and is easily cleaned.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,purchased two of these.  Pros: very comfortable for the children to sit for long periods of time. my toddlers put on and take off themselves. neutral color. easy to clean.  Cons: on one seat the handle ring broke off within 8 months. seat stains can only be removed with bleach - otherwise all stains show fast. no side handles for child to hold onto or back for child to lean against. it just sits on toiler seat - no latching.  Overall: my girls have no problem with it and recommend this product over all other seats. I clean it often b/c it is white - which is probably good.,4,1
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,"Great, simple potty seat that fits on my toilet perfectly.  I feel like my daughter is safe on it and it makes her feel like a grown up since the basic white matches perfectly. Great value, who needs all those bells and whistles.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,"This seat is very padded and comfortable for my baby. It's thicker than it looks in the picture. I haven't had trouble with it sliding around, but she's not that active yet.  I don't think the hook that came with it is very great because it kept falling off the wall.  I bought a suction one instead.Great price though. I would definitely buy this again.",4,1
"Sunshine Kids Sure Steps Safety Strap, Blue","I was originally debating on this purchase.  But after I used it on our vacation to Mexico with my 18mo old, I now consider this the best purchase I made for that trip.One note, if the child wants to pull away, and is strong enough, the Velcro will detach or at least loosen.  So I would say that this is for the really little ones, but as they get older, they will quickly learn how to escape.",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Sure Steps Safety Strap, Blue","This is a must have for those with toddlers or multiples.  This is especially useful in large crowds - Disney, summer festivals...",5,1
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety Brackets,"We are on our second set of these brackets, having used them at a previous residence for a couple of years.I never had any issues with our brackets becoming hardened and breaking, although living in Southern California, I imagine we don't experience some of the temperature extremes people do elsewhere (even though it seems we all probably run our air/heat and keep inside temps relatively the same, no?)Yes, the screws are made from a cheap metal, which really makes little sense because they'll pop in two in stud. After initial frustration when I first bought the brackets I ran down to the home improvement store and picked up a package of small screws and used those instead, and drilled lead holes, and have had no problems.As far as holes in your furniture are concerned, I figure it's a small price to pay for safety. We've also used these straps to loop around items so we don't have to drill into them, with great success.Personally, I do NOT use these brackets on anything truly heavy. They're great for smaller items, particularly those you might need to move from time to time to clean underneath, vacuum under, etc.  The brackets are hard enough to get off that my children have never been able to remove them, but easy enough that I don't avoid moving our nightstands, toy organizers, dollhouse, etc. in order to get the area nice and clean.If you're looking to secure something mid-weight, I highly recommend the KidCo furniture straps. For heavyweight items I love using the Quakehold! furniture straps (which don't have to be screwed into your furniture, but can be if you prefer).Growing up in SoCal and living through several big earthquakes and as a mother of three children (one of which seems to be part monkey) I've found that there's no single product that is going to secure everything in your house, but I definitely keep these brackets around as part of my furniture securing ""kit"".",4,1
Tommee Tippee Milk Feeding Bibs - Cream - 2 Pk - Boy,"I use these bibs as teething bibs to catch all of my son's drool.  These are the only bibs I know of that have the padding near the neckline.  Love these bibs.  They keep his chin and chest dry.  These were also great when he was a newborn, because babies have folds in their necks and if drool or milk gets in there, it can cause a rash.  These bibs keep the neck area dry and protected.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray",Works for infant seats and booster seats with backing.  The back keeps flopping forward if used with backless booster seats.,4,1
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray","This seat cover is great. It does what it says. My son's car seat stays put, and it keeps my back seat clean- free of sticky beverages and foods!",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray",This thing is great.  My daughter throws stuff out of her chair.  And this is good about catching the food she tosses.  It is saving the leather seats in my jeep.,5,1
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray",So much cheaper than competitors and works the same.  It is perfect for daughter's booster seat.  Doing makes great products.,5,1
"Sunshine Kids Cool Shade For Car Window, Black","It is a great buy worthy of spending. I have them already over a year, and they are still there on the window providing cool shade for my little one. Highly recommended.",4,1
"Sunshine Kids Cool Shade For Car Window, Black","Easy to apply, as long as you are not super-picky about bubbles. My husband just threw them on, and you'd have to look pretty critically to notice bubbles. We like that you can put them anywhere - we had initially bought for our 2nd car, then bought another set to &#34;fill in the holes&#34; on our 1st car (we have those suction-cup shades and they let sun thru in some areas since it's a large SUV, these work nicely as a supplement because they are so flexible).",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Cool Shade For Car Window, Black","These are great sunshades, they really block the sun and keep it out of my kiddos' eyes...the only drawback is that they can be a bit difficult to see through (and I have one on both sides of the car since I have 13 mo. old twins).  But overall a great product!",4,1
Mommy's Helper Panda Door Pinch Guard,"LOVE love love this product!  So great to protect my children's fingers, and even stop the door from bumping when a window is open.  Cute and helpful.  Thanks.",5,1
Safety 1st 3 Level Booster Seat,"When we were ready to graduate from the high chair to a booster seat we did our research to find the best booster seat.  Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster seat had the best reviews and we decided that we would purchase that seat.When I looked at the booster seat more carefully in the store it was a great seat.  It had everything we needed.  The price was a little on the high side but with all the great reviews, we decided to buy it.  As we were walking to the register we realized that we only wanted a booster seat.  The Fisher Price booster had a detachable tray.  What made this seat so great was that it was like the Fisher Price high chair with the dishwasher safe inserts on the tray.  We did not need the trays.  The boys high chairs had adjustable height and we had been using them with out the trays and sliding them up to the table to eat.  All we wanted was a booster for the chairs.We went back to look over all are other options.  Most of the boosters came with trays and others clipped onto the side of your table.  The Safety First 3 Level Booster was the simplest one for the best price.It straps onto your chairs.  There is only one strap but it is very long.  It straps around the back of your chair.  The underside of the chair has rubber feat to prevent it from sliding.  It does say if you have cushions to remove them off the chair.Weight limit I believe is 40-50 lbs.  Your child will be 4-5 by then and should be able to sit in a regular seat.It is in two pieces: the seat and the base.  You select the height level you want and slide the seat into the slot.Very simple for clean up.  No little cracks or crevices.  Can even take it to the sink and wash it down.Does not come with seat belt.  There are slots for seat belts.  I believe you can call the company and order one if you need too.  We have not had any issues.  Since you are using your own chairs they slide under the table.It does not fold up like other boosters for easy travel.  It is not bulky or heavy though.Most booster seats come with a tray.  If your are looking for just a booster this one is a very fair price.  Other booster seats clip onto the side of your table.  If you have a thick table they may not fit.The Safety First 3 level booster was the best seat for the money.",4,1
Safety 1st 3 Level Booster Seat,Very safe. Very easy to clean.  Secures well to the chair.  I'm about to buy a second one for my daughter.  I recommend putting a towel over the chair seat before you strap on the booster.  This will keep you from staining the chair. Safety was a priority for us.  We previously purchased a different booster that had problems.  The previous seat did not lock in properly so my son kept falling.  This seat locks in very securely and he has never fallen.,5,1
Puppy Sleep Sack - Small,"This is SUCH a good idea.  I felt like I was freezing my child not putting a blanket on them as they slept to keep them safe.  This put my mind at ease and kept the little one warm.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  They also make them in lighter materials, which is great for warmer houses and weather.",5,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,We use this at daycare to hold cloth diapers.  We line with a plastic bag and bring the dirties home daily.  Virginia state health code requires that diapers pails at daycare have to have a pedal open top for.  For the price this fits the bill. It's large enough that is could hold 2-3 days worth of diapers but I think odors would become a problem. At home we just use a hanging zippered wet bag that we can throw into the wash with diapers.,4,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"I've been using this for over 9 months.  I haven't had any problems with the pedal not working as long as I push the lid down firmly.  As far as the claim that it &#34;Uses standard plastic bags&#34; - I thought that meant Wal-Mart bags.  The fitting for those bags is rather tight and only uses about half the capacity of the diaper pail.  It really uses XL bags - thankfully the grocery store in my area provides these.  The diaper pail contains the smell well.  By the time the smell is getting bothersome, the bag is pretty full and it's time to change the bag anyways.",4,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"It's great for what it is, I just wish it was a little bigger. However it is easy to use and looks cute! And I love that I don't need to waste money on bag refills, I just use walmart plastic bags or any other grocery store bag and that to me is greener! :)",4,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"We have been using this for cloth diapers (bummis and oso cozy unbleached prefolds with Thirsties Duo Snap covers) and cloth wipes for about one year now, with Planet Wise Diaper Pail Liner - Ocean diaper pail liners.  When we went from the 8-15 pound diapers to the 15-30 pound ones we thought we would need to get a larger pail, but we have found that this pail remains adequate for the most part.  By the end of day two when I start the laundry regimen there are a few diapers emerging out of the pail lid, and while not ideal, it's not really a big deal either.  Besides, from what I have read and based on first hand experience, it's actually good to let air circulate through your dirty diapers, so now I intentionally use a clean corner of diaper to keep the lid propped partially open anyhow.  With a baking soda disc (Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack)in the lid compartment, and as long as I rinse soiled diapers/wipes before depositing them in the pail, there is no noticeable odor even with the lid propped open. I learned the hard way that you really do have to do the diaper laundry every two days (if you do not you will get ammonia build up - your diapers should never smell like ammonia, even when dirty), so a significantly larger pail is not necessary.  If this one were just a tad larger it would be about perfect, but for the price it's at least worthy of 4 stars.",4,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"I was skeptical about this pail,  but it work great at hiding the smell.  I use it for cat litter and i don't smell a thing with the lid closed.",5,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"I know that this is a diaper pail, but I really needed something for my used litter, since I didn't want to throw a plastic bag away every day.  It's perfect!  It's small enough that it fits under my sink and it surprisingly keeps all of the odors in (and you know how potent cat urine/feces can smell!).  I highly recommend it!!",5,1
Skip Hop Dash - Canvas-Chocolate,"I have had this bag for over 2 years and it is still in great shape.  I used it with my son and now with my newborn daughter.  It is perfect for a day out, and I love that there are separate straps that attach to the stroller.  You don't have to use the separate straps on the stroller, my husband just shortens the straps and places the bag over the stroller handle.",5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,"It should be noted, as mentioned in the other reviews, that the breast shields are one piece.  They are the standard size that came with my pump, so if you need a different size, this kit is not for you.  Despite the fact that the shields do not come apart, I didn't find them that much more difficult to clean.  Especially if you already have a brush on hand for cleaning bottles.The reason that I almost didn't buy this kit was because of the bottles in the picture.  They looked nothing like those that were included with my pump and I wanted them to have the same easy to read oz. markings on the side.  I eventually decided to take the risk because of the savings of buying the kit vs. purchasing them separately, and I'm so glad that I did.  The bottles that arrived are the newer style with the Medela logo on them and the easy to read oz. markings.",5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,"If you are a working mom like me who uses her pump 3-4 times a day, then you will certainly get some use out of having an extra set of shields and 4 extra bottles for storage. I feel like I wash these parts constantly, so having some extras is really neccessary. So glad they make this set! Love it!",5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,"This was a gift for a co-worker having her first baby. After several conversations with other women involving the breast pump subject and returning to work, this product was highly recommended by all! Have also had very good service with Amazon!!",5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,I bought this kit for extra parts for my Medela breast pump. This kit lasted me throughout me during my 10 months of pumping and was a great extra set,5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,Went perfectly with my used breast pump I bought a pump from a friend and had to buy new accessories and these fit perfectly and was really nice!!,5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,"I have used the same pump for both of my kids (pump in style) and love the convenience and ease of use. I wanted to refurbish it for my second baby, with all new accessories. This does the trick. The only thing I was frustrated with was that it does NOT contain the tubing. That has to be purchased separately.",4,1
Eddie Bauer 2 Level Wooden Booster Seat,"My 20-month daughter loves this booster seat, it makes her feel very grown up sitting right at the table with us.  I like the wood look and the washable fabric cushion.  My only complaint is the strap system--instead of being secured right to the back of the seat, the strap has an extra piece that allows my daughter to stand up in the chair while still strapped in.  It doesn't seem 100% safe so I always make sure I'm close by when she's in the chair.",4,1
Eddie Bauer 2 Level Wooden Booster Seat,I have 2 of these high chairs for my 6 month twin boys. They work out wonderful.  They save some space. Design is great.,5,1
Yoga Monkey 15&quot;,"There are no other animals like those of Gund.  They make the most cuddly and &#34;realistic&#34; little creatures that I've seen many kids carry around like their favorite blankeys.  This was bought as a gift for a friend and their son carries it like it is attached to him.  Another child I know loves the froggy.  Gund products are better than a lot of other stuffies because these can be washed - there are no extra plastic type of eyes or accessories that can fall off or break.  The stitching  is quite strong.  My only advice is buy more than 1 of the exact same animal - we bought 3 of the exact same animal and kept 2 hidden away and swap them out when one is in the wash (or if 1 gets lost).  After a couple years it is quite difficult to find the exact same animal - so if you know your child loves to carry it around, buy 3.  9 years later mine still loves and sleeps with her newborn gift.",5,1
Marathon Convertible Car Seat - Platinum,"The Marathon is roomy and comfy for my big boy.  But the straps on the car seat get twisted alot.  I don't care for the rubber things on the straps either, they are annoying.  I do feel safe with this car seat and it has a really easy stallation system, I was so happy with the way they latch system (rear facing )works in my car, super easy to put in.  And the seat doesn't budge.  I had a few questions and called Britax and was surprised to find no 800 number available.  I would think that for the high price of their car seats and how many of them they sell they could at least offer their consumers a toll free number for questions.  But nope, I was on hold for almost ten minutes waiting for an answer.  Other than that I am happy with my choice.",4,1
Marathon Convertible Car Seat - Platinum,"Our son is a big boy for his age.  At six months he had already grown out of his Graco infant car seat.  My husband and I didn't want to have to keep upsizing car seats every time he hit a growth spurt, so we decided to go with the seat that would last the longest.  Sure, it's more expensive than the other options on the market, but when we put him in the Marathon (rear facing) he was so comfortable.  We were worried that with his young age he wouldn't be able to sit upright without his head falling forward in the toddler car seats.  With the reclining back of the Marathon seat however, he's safe and cozy during the whole ride.  His head even stays in place when asleep!  No head positioner's needed.  We're extremely satisfied with this carseat and we recommend it to all of our friends with children.",5,1
Bummis Super Whisper Wrap Diaper Cover: Medium (15-30lbs),"This is the first cover I've tried and it's great.  I don't plan on trying others.  It leaked the first time I used it because I hadn't adjusted it properly but since I check the fit, no leaks!!  I use cloth while at home to cut down on costs.  I don't recommend them for overnight...but if you want something affordable for during the day this is a winner.",4,1
Kissaluvs Contour Diaper: NB/S (5-20 lbs),"These are both Mommy & Daddy approved cloth diapers!  Dad loves how easy these are to put on and figure out - no folding techniques, no guess work.  Just fold over and use a snappi or pins and throw on a cover.  Many times we don't even use fasteners on our more snug fitting covers.They are soft, absorbant and dry in a relatively short amount of time compared to others I have tried.  They include a doubler with a single seam design to cut down on drying time.We love these!",5,1
Bummis Super Snap Diaper Cover: Medium (15-30 lbs).,"My son quickly learned how to unvelcro the other covers, so after a lot of research, I decided on these covers. They have been workhorses. They dry in a snap, wash nicely, and I've not had a problem with leaks. He may leak overnight, but not during the day like he did with the other non-Bummis covers we had.",5,1
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds","I used this over my well hydrated son's night time pull up for extra protection and it has saved plenty of sheet washings. Also, it's growing with him very well. I got it when he was around 33lbs and it was big but still protected well. He's now 40lbs and it's still going strong. It cleans easily in the washer.",5,1
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds",These covers rock!  They hold the ickiest you know what in.  I never had a blowout with Bummi diaper covers.  LOVE THEM!Also the velcro is great.  It has not worn out after many washes.  We will be able to use these with the next baby.,5,1
Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream 6.7 ounces,"My sweet baby boy started suffering from eczema last year when he was three months old. We kept it at bay last winter with Aveeno's Eczema Therapy lotion, but it never fully went away. His skin issues returned full force this winter -- as soon as it got cold outside, he started to get scaly and red from head to toe. Stelatopia is the only thing that works. I use it all over his body, every night, after his bath, and then I put Aquaphor or CJ's BUTTer on his individual eczema spots. He would just be one big red scale without these products! Love!",5,1
Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream 6.7 ounces,My baby had a small patch of Eczema on his cheek.  This gentle lotion cleared it right up! I only put it on in the morning and within a few days it was gone.  There is really no smell to it and it is so gentle on little ones' skin.  It is worth the price!,5,1
Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream 6.7 ounces,I love all of the mustela products. My daughter is 12 months and has very bad ezama. Two days for using the cream and it is almost gone. V,5,1
Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream 6.7 ounces,My girls have mild eczema and this lotion is great at keeping it at bay.  We use it as our everyday lotion.  Highly recommend!,5,1
Quilted Pack N Play Sheet - Ecru,"I liked this sheet a lot better than Graco's regular Pack 'N Play sheet.  It has elastic all of the way around the bottom to keep the sheet snug and in place.  I also don't wash it particularly gently and it comes out fine.  I just wish they had more options (colors and softer fabrics), considering they are essentially the only manufacturers of this type of product.",4,1
"Kiddopotamus Beddiebye Zip Around Safety Blanket Microfleece Small, Blue","I haven't seen this sleep blanket available anywhere for awhile.  I would purchase it as baby shower gifts as I loved it for my kids.  Had the 0-6 month size (small) and the 6-12 month large size.  I used them for my kids from  birth to probably around 1 1/2 years.  They were cozy, comfortable, easy to zip and wash and it kept them warm without being bulky.  I liked the idea of the sleeveless design, but wish they had used snaps instead of the velcro as it could be loud enough to wake the baby up if the sleep blanket was being removed.  The zip-around design was perfect for easily putting it on a sleeping baby without waking.  Simply lay the open blanket on crib, lay baby on it, zip & velcro them in.",5,1
Imse Vimse Soft Diaper Covers - Hoop and Loop - Newborn - White,"These covers are great. Our daughter has started to outgrow the Newborn size and we're planning to order more in the larger size.They fasten quickly and easily with no chance that I'll prick her with a pin.The only downside is that they tend to stain -- if she has a blowout, there's a slight stain on the cover. But who sees the inside of the cover anyway?I would definitely recommend these covers to anyone considering cloth diapers.",5,1
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),I've been using these since my little one has been eating solids and they are great. They cut down on all the yucky partS of cloth diapering. They are gentel on the skin and also on your septic system.  Also you can wash and reuse if there is no Solid waist on them.,5,1
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),"These aren't anything fancy, but they make poo-poo cleanup worlds easier when working with disposable diapers. :) I would recommend them to anyone who is considering doing cloth diapering. Mine held up going through the wash for about 2 loads, so I was able to reuse them if they were only peed on. :)",5,1
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),"I've been spraying my diapers all this time. I can't believe how much easier this makes the job. If I had known what I was missing before I never would have waited so long to try them. Everyone who takes turns changing baby agrees that these liners have been the best thing we've done yet. In fact, I haven't even had to use my diaper sprayer since getting these, which is nice because I often vacation and no longer have to disconnect and reconnect a sprayer onto toilets wherever I stay. Also a plus when changing baby somewhere I couldn't/wouldn't want to dunk a diaper (like a public toilet). Even with very soft messes it's a savior. Most of a soft mess, if not all, comes out with a simple lift of the paper and solid messes are always contained! I also feel it's been reducing the amount of potential stain on my prefolds because of the paper barrier reducing the contact of the waste to the cloth.The reason I had hesitated before was because I thought that one of the reasons I wanted to use cloth was to avoid anything harsh, scratchy, or papery on my baby's skin. Why use soft cloth to then slap paper on top? In reality, while they're not super soft, they're so thin, I feel like they compact and mold well to the baby and don't seem to irritate at all. Additionally, I find I can wash the liners that had been urine soaked a few times with the soiled diapers before needing to toss it and after being washed they get very soft, like a very thin and gauzy cotton which feels almost pleasant to the touch.I will absolutely keep using these and recommend them to everyone I know who is currently diapering.",5,1
Wendy Bellissimo Honey Bee 5 Piece Crib Set,"I bought this exact pattern from a small upscale boutique before Wendy Bellisimo started designing for BRU. Needless to say, it was double the price (fortunately, I got it on clearance). I couldn't believe it when I saw it in BRU! I love the pattern and it seems like this new line is almost as high quality as her $500 brand- you can hardly see the difference! In fact, I like the quilt in this line much better than mine. I love that the bumper covers can be removed and washed. Perfect gender-neutral bedding that can be easily have blue or pink added to the nursery after the baby comes. My only ""afterthought"" is that the bumpers are very pillowy, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending that you not use pillows or bumper pads in cribs as a SIDS prevention. We used ours with 3 of the 4 bumper pads and my son seems to have plenty of room. LOVE IT!!",5,1
Chicco C5 Umbrella Stroller,"We've had this stroller for about a month now, and my husband and I absolutly love this stroller! It's the perfect height for him because he's very tall, and he doesn't kick the wheels in the back anymore. I love it because of it's stylish look, it's comfortable for my daughter, 22mths. old, it's light, and it's super easy to fold down and up!!I did read the reviews before and was aware of the back bending in, which honestly steered me away from the stroller at first. It was when we actually went to Babies R Us  and saw the 2 models on the floor that made me change my mind. One of the strollers must have been the old model because I did notice how the back of the seat gave in, but the other model's seat did not. My husband felt the panels in the back of the seat, and there was a huge difference in them. Chicco must have fixed this problem because the newer ones back panels of the seats would not budge a bit when my husband tried to bend it, and the older model was way too easy bend.So, when you go to buy it, ask them to open the box and make sure you're getting the newer model with the harder seat panels!! That's what we did, and we're super happy!!!",5,1
Sumersault Puppy Plane Lampshade,"I love this lamp shade. It is really cute & matches perfectly with everything! The cost is high for just a shade, but worth it!",4,1
Sumersault Puppy Plane Lampshade,I bought the crib bedding at another store and I was so excited to see the prices for the the matching accents! This is a very nice and high quality item. I was very impressed with the overall look and how well it matches the rest of the decor.,4,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","I don't have any particular preference for Avent's bottles or other products in general, but I used this Avent bottle brush at a friend's house and immediately went out and got my own. I can't imagine ever again using one of those spiral deals with the wire down the middle... *shudder*  Get this brush and get on with your dishes.",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","I have bought different kind of brushes from Target, Walmart and amazon.com.  This brush design is the best.  It won't splash on your face when you brush hard on the baby bottle. It cleans very very well.  However, if you want to wash nipple only; you need to buy a addition different brush for nipple.",4,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","This is a great bottle brush. It works in just about any size container. It even squeezes into those slim tube-like containers for storing breast milk (I wasn't sure it would). It is more expensive than most bottle brushes, but it is definitely worth it because it works better, doesn't have to be replaced frequently (if ever), is easier to clean/rinse the soap off of, and cleans all bottle and pump parts very easily.Unlike most bottle brushes, this one has more spaced out bristles that are stronger and more flexible. Those flexible bristles are what make it possible to squeeze it into small containers and clean every nook and cranny of the bottle and pump parts that have a lot of nooks and crannies. The strength of the bristles keeps it from losing its shape and function after squeezing it into those nooks and crannies. No matter how much I abuse it (by using it to clean those small milk storage containers), it never shows. Plus it doesn't have that gross falling apart sponge thing at the end that others have. I also have the Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack and this bottle brush fits perfectly into the little cup container at the top of it.",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","Easy to use, angled so you don't get wet when you pull it out of the bottle. Good bottle brush.",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","This is a great bottle brush. It does not splatter you with soapy/dirty water when you pull it out of the bottle you are cleaning. The bristles are not too soft, but not too hard either. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone looking for a quality bottle brush.",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","I use the brush to clean both wide neck and classic bottles, even the tip of the bottle nipples. Good brush design.",5,1
Kidco White Door Lever Locks,"I was worried at first that these lever locks would not work on our doors as the levers all face to the left where we needed to install them. Reviews of some other lever locks stated that they could only be used on handles that faced to the right.  These locks work on levers that face either way, however.  They were easy to install.  I used the adhesive rather than the screws and have not had a problem so far.  My 4 year old figured it out in about 15 seconds and my 2 1/2 year old figured one out once.  It is still difficult for him and is definitely a deterrent.",5,1
Kidco White Door Lever Locks,This product is perfect for keeping my Grandson safe. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with little ones running around!,5,1
KidCo Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock,"If I had saved the cabinet latches that I removed when my kids grew out of the need for these, I never would have found these GREAT latches! I had already purchased another type of safety latch at a local store, but had not yet installed them because they seemed unnecessarily complicated. No big deal, but they had actual metal springs on the bendable prongs and it seemed to me that simple flexible plastic would do, like the ones I had taken down years ago. (I think I actually did save them, but do you think I can find them now?). Anyway, in the search for an alternative, I came across these and, wow! - am I glad I did. Once you re-install safety latches, you find all over again just how annoying it is to open a cabinet or drawer only to have it come to a sudden stop and you think - &#34;Oh, yeah. Those %#@* safety latches!&#34;  It takes weeks or months to re-learn the smooth opening action with the safety latch push integrated into the motion. But now we don't have to!  When the Grandkids (just one so far but we're keeping our fingers crossed) are coming over we &#34;turn on&#34; the latches and when they leave we just rotate them 90 degrees and can enjoy smooth, uninterrupted cabinet and drawer opening until their next visit. Life is bliss!",5,1
KidCo Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock,Bottom line.  These work and they are cheap.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because 1 of the screws snapped.  If they get stronger screws its automatic 5 stars.,4,1

"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary","Love this one. We bought another brand to just put small snacks in as well, and do not like it nearly as much. This one is very durable. Wish I would have just bought two of these.",5,1
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary","This powdered formula dispenser is one of my favorite baby gadgets! Three compartments hold pre-measured formula amount, so when baby wakes for a middle of the night feeding, all you have to do is flip the lid open and dump the formula into the bottle. Small enough to throw in the diaper bag, and perfect for errands or daycare. That way you don't have to rely on someone else to get the measuring right. It's inexpensive, easy to clean, even easier to use, and totally worth the few bucks it costs. I just ordered another!",5,1
Munchkin: Fresh Food Feeder Colors vary,"Great product.  We use it when we go out to eat and it keeps the baby busy.  Our favorite thing to use in it is frozen peach slices.  You can buy a bag at the grocery store that's already sliced and frozen- done!  We've also used ice cubes, frozen apple juice, apple slices, cantaloupe, honeydew, etc.",5,1
Munchkin: Fresh Food Feeder Colors vary,"Bought this for my grand daughter, she loves it!  Easy clean up in the dishwasher.  Great product for introducing new foods to your child.",5,1
KidCo Anti-Tip Furniture Straps,"I love this strap. It is easy to install and holds the furniture firmly against the wall. The directions say to always use two straps for each piece of furniture. For my little, light stuff I used one and couldn't tip it even when trying to pull it over. I used three on my tall, heavy bookshelf though just because it is a little top heavy and I didn't want to risk it falling. It is very sturdy now. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of it being plastic and if the strap isn't pulled tight enough it could slip off of the one end of the bracket. If they are installed correctly this isn't a problem though.",4,1
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Silicone BPA Free Pacifier, 0-6 months, Colors May Vary","The five stars that I have given this product is for the product itself.  However, the colors I received were not even pictured.  Luckily for me, I liked the colors I received so I'm keeping the product.  So, if you like having control over what you get, I would recommend buying it in person at a brick and mortar store.The pacifiers themselves are well made and are extremely cute when in use!  I would love if my daughter would use hers more often, but she prefers her hands.",5,1
Adhesive Mount Cabinet/Drawer Lock,Have an 11 year old beagle that gets into EVERYTHING!  This is the first cabinet lock that he can't get into to open our garbage drawer.  So easy to install and there are extra parts in case you need to install it a different way.  LOVE it!  Now my dog has become extremely destructive and spiteful... but that's a whole other story!  This product works ;),5,1
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","For some reason my baby doesn't care for these. They are a great product, soft silicone, flexible, sturdy and well-made.. Your baby may love it, who knows?",5,1
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","I have bought 2 sets of these because they work well and are pretty well priced.  The are pretty easy for my 11 month old to pick up and use and durable.  I haven't really tried any other sippy cups besides Green Sprouts, which are not that great.  Your child has to suck on the sippy cup part to make the water come out, which is actually what they recommended at my day care so they don't choke when drinking.",5,1
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary",It is very hard to find a cup that does not leak. You have to turn the tops on these cups all the way to the line on the top of the cup and they will not leak at all!,5,1
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary",We have both this and the ones with the straw for my kid.  She seems to like this more so we keep getting this one.  It does drip a little but doesn't flip you in the eye like the straw ones.  Note that when you put cold fluids in this they will leak out due to expansion of the air as they warm up if your kid isn't using it.  FYI,5,1
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary","When our 10 month old daughter started solids a few months ago, her pediatrician recommended introducing water in a sippy cup at meals.  Apparently the current recommendation is that babies should be transitioned from bottles to cups by 1 year, and by offering her water she would learn to use a cup by the time she needed to make the switch.We picked up these sippy cups because we use Playtex Nursers for her breast milk at daycare and have been happy with the quality and value.  We liked that they were spill proof and had handles to make it easier for her to hold the cup.  She does prefer an open cup but it requires a lot of parental/caregiver effort to help her drink from one without spilling everywhere, so these sippies are a good choice all around.  It took her some time to figure out the cup but she's a pro at it now.They don't leak if you assemble them properly.  She can bang the darned thing upside down on her high chair tray and it won't leak a drop!  I have no idea why other reviewers have trouble cleaning these and have had the opposite experience. We have never had problems with mold or mildew, but to be fair she only drinks water from a cup (no juice at all, and she gets breastmilk from the tap or in a bottle) and we empty the cups after every use and wash them often. They're inexpensive so we were able to buy two 2-packs and have two at home and two for the daycare rotation.She will be transitioning to a straw-type cup for breast milk at daycare in another month or two, around her birthday.  We're using theThe First Lil' Gripper Twist 'n Click Straw Cupnow as a trainer cup for this purpose.",5,1
"Gerber Ultra-Thin Nursing Pads, 60pk","The downside of wearing most nursing pads is that everyone can tell you are wearing nursing pads. These pads, due to their thinness, do not advertise their presence but still protect your clothing against leakage.",5,1

New Native Baby Carrier: Khaki Small (chest size 30-33&quot;),"I love this carrier. My baby likes to sit on my hip and this carrier supports her weight and stabilizes her so that I can get some things done and still carry her around.I found that I needed a size smaller than what was suggested, but all-in-all this is a very comfortable carrier and the fabric is breathable, unlike the Baby Bjorn that I was using, which she would sweat in and could only face my chest or forward and could not be used on the hip.[...]",4,1
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),"These cups serve their purpose in that my 10 month old can use it and not have all of his snack dumped out in one second.  However, it doesn't take him too long to make a mess with it!  I do think they're a good value, though.",4,1

"Infantino Peek, Rattle and Teether","I ordered this for my five month old daughter and I want to say that she isn't impressed, however, she may just be too young so I'll give her more time.  She seems to enjoy them for a few minutes then it's off to something else (but that's most babies, right?).  I like them because they're unique, durable and easy to clean.  I'll keep them around for later.  I would recommend them.",4,1

Infantino Surfboard Tummy Time Mat Blue,"This was one of the first toys I bought my 2month old daughter. I really loved the surf board design- I thought it looked cooler than most of the cheesier mats.My daughter isnt quite old enough to fully enjoy tummy time. She is just learning to push her head up and doesnt get to play yet when she is on her tummy. She enjoys ""back time"" so far and the pillow offers good support when combined with a blanket.When we initially opened the box, we were extremely pleased with the appearance of the product. Its bright and cheery and the toys attach and detach easily for use in the carseat or crib. (Which we do frequently- She loves the crab)My fiance had some trouble filling the plastic bubble. We both assumed it was to prevent leaks..so we were ok with that. The only real complaint is the bubble doesn't fit tightly into the mat and the edges of the mat buckle up, exposing the sharp edges of the bubble. The edges of the bubble seem like they could easily scratch a small child.We havent had any issues with the bubble water ""fogging"" or greying up, but I assume a small drop of bleach in the bubble would keep it clean.So far it has been pretty durable as we frequently roll it up(with the bubble inside) to store and transport it. We have had no leaks.Overall, it was a good buy for the money. She has gotten alot of enjoyment out of the attachments and Im sure it will progress to the mat once she can hold her head up better.",4,1
Infantino Surfboard Tummy Time Mat Blue,"I bought this for my cousin, who is a surfer herself. She was expecting her first child and I had to get this. It was a bit hit at her baby shower. Everyone loved it and asked where I found it, since it's not in stores.",5,1

To us.. the Bjorn is worth every penny!!",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Blue Retro","My son has loved this product since I started putting him in it. I received it as a hand-me-down, but would have definitely registered for one if I hadn't. It is a great product that allows you to carry your child hands free for shopping, working around the house, or just walking off that baby weight. When he was smaller, he felt very secure snuggled up against me, and now that he's getting bigger, I can flip him around and let him see the world, and still be hands free!I don't think I would try to breastfeed in this, and I have never been able to take him out without waking him, but I still love this!",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Blue Retro","I love this carrier, my baby does too!  I have been able to clean, garden and doing it all while holding my newborn in the BB.

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","We bought this just after our baby was born.  It works great for short walks and going to the mall without the big stroller.  The only thing we didn't realize is that the straps go around our back and not around our waist.  This took a time or two to get used to, but after that it's fine.  Also, it says it's for ""8 lbs and above"", which was a disappointment at first when we brought home a 7 lb baby.  But we use it now, a few weeks later, without any problems.  Definately worth considering purchasing.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","This baby carrier is wonderful. We have used it almost daily with our now 9 month old. We used the original bjorn for our first baby and loved it. We got this one for our second baby. This one is just as good, with nice improvements. The ability to detach the carrier so you can lay down a sleeping infant is really handy. The back support is also nice. I tried other baby carriers and ended up returning them because they just weren't as easy to use and baby would always get frustrated. Others also also didn't seem to be as secure or weren't as comfortable to wear. The bjorn is a little pricey, but for the use you get out of it think it is well worth the cost.",5,1

I wasn't sure how I was going to get around with the two of them, but the carrier has been a huge help.  I use it everywhere I go!  I can easily and quickly put my youngest in the carrier and then we go to the park, shopping, or just run errands.  The baby is able to sleep in it or look around and discover her new world!  I would be lost without it.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I had not tried this brand before, this was a very good option. The baby is enjoying it very much.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","Initially, I wasn't sure about spending so much on this carrier, but it has been a great investment. Those first few colicky months, strapping my baby into this and going for a nice walk was sometimes the only way I got any sanity back. He loved it and so did I!!! As it got cooler outside, this was also handy because I could strap my baby on facing out and put a big coat over both of us zipped up so that just my baby's face was sticking out and we were both snug and warm and ready to go for a fall walk! I gave it 4 stars though, because as my baby got to be about 17 pounds, my back starts to get pretty sore wearing him in this. I don't think I will be using it til 25 pounds, but I still got a lot of use out of it!Update: After reading numerous rave reviews of the Ergo carrier and really wanting a carrier to use hiking, I bit my lip and bought an Ergo. I was really shocked at how comfortable a 120 lb woman carrying a 20 lb kid on her back could really be! So, for a really young infant, I still think the Bjorn is definitely handy and I'm glad I purchased it, but for heavier children, I'd definitely recommend the Ergo.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","We bought this carrier because we live in South/Central Texas.  It was the only one that was safe, breathable and lightweight.  It costs a bit more than some others but is so easy to use and take on and off.  My daughter smiles when she sees me put it on.  We have several other slings and carriers but we use this one the most.  If I had to shop for a carrier again I would just buy this one and no others. I do grocery shopping and go everywhere with this carrier.  It has been comfortable and the best baby purchase to date.  also.. the main sling part has a built in net/pouch that the whole thing (straps and all) packs up in.  It fits right in the diaper bag without taking up much room.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I found this carrier to be safe and easy to use but my daughter, who at 5 months is over 20 pounds, is outgrowing it.  Most people will be able to use it much longer than we will.  It provided head support when she was a newborn and now that she is bigger she enjoys facing out and seeing the world. At this size the top folds down and she can experience the outdoors as I let her touch trees, for example.  All in all a great product.  If they come out with one adjustable up to 40 pounds I'll be first in line.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","this is almost a must...just in case you really need your hands free...cant do dishes with it , but you CAN go to the bathroom...if you really had to...lol",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",Love this product!! Borrowed it from a friend and had to get it for my baby!! Walked around a store today for 2 hours and my 4 week old slept in the carrier the entire time!!!!,4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I love this carrier. I have tried the boba and the maya wraps but our baby definitely prefers the Baby Bjorn. I have an 11 and 13 year old and both also spent their infancy in this carrier. I should not have wasted my money on the wraps. &#34;If it ain't broke....&#34;,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I have tried other carriers. This is by far the best! Fast and easy to put on/off including adjusting.So comfortable for both me and baby. I use it everyday. Worth the price.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","There have been so many times we really loved this carrier.  Originally, though, I wanted a sling because I thought they were better for baby, like the previous reviewer, and all my crunchy friends recommended them.  They may be, but we've tried the hotsling, the maya wrap, and even the ergo baby carrier, and this is by far the best and easiest for us.For months, the only way to get my baby to stop his colicky crying was to put him in the Bjorn and go for a walk.  It would put him right to sleep like magic, and we'd come inside, lean over his rocker, and unlatch the Bjorn with him in it (the outer piece comes completely off) and he would just stay asleep.  Try that with a sling!Now that he's past his colicky phase, I use the sling a lot and it's great, but for a quick run to the store, nothing beats the Bjorn for speed.  It's so easy to put on and take off - and it's also easier to get my husband (and my dad!) to wear the baby with the Bjorn, he thinks the sling is for moms.I had two problems: at about 20 pounds and 27 inches, his arms don't fit in the arm holes, and they don't fit above them either.  It still works without the top latches, though, and it's cooler in summer.  I just keep a hold on him to be sure.  And when he was a couple months old and I was wearing the Bjorn a lot, I got a plugged milk duct.  I thought it was about where the strap lay on my chest, so I stopped wearing the Bjorn for a while.  I was having other breastfeeding problems at the time so it might not have been the Bjorn, but who knows?I got this as a hand-me-down, and I thought it was going to just collect dust, but boy was I wrong.  It's in the washer right now!",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",The BabyBjorn Baby Carrier was my life saver.  I have a 5 month old daughter and she loves it.  I am able to do what ever and have my hands free.  She will sit frontwards and play or towards me and sleep.  I bought it because she did not like her stroller and we were getting ready to go on vacation to Disneyland I wore it for 3 days and never once did my back or shoulders hurt.  I was truly amazed how comfortable it was to wear.  I wish I had bought this sooner.  I recommend any mom getting this.  I have two other children 10 and 8 and never had one thought they looked uncomfortable I was so wrong I could have made my life a lot easier had I had one when they were babies.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I am so lazy that I wont generally write those review, but this one I could not resist myself.I bought this product in April 2010 after month long research on various brands and types of infant carriers. It was worth a buy. I've used it for two consecutive days for 14 hours each day. Baby and dad were comfortable. When I placed baby first he was little fuzzy but then in few minutes he adapted to it. Baby was 2 months old, when I used it first. It was easy to carry and is load balanced. I feel baby is lighter on this carrier compare to when you just lift him up. One can avoid a bulky stroller with the convenience of BabyBjorn. Quality of the fabric used to make it was good. We were on vacation trip with the baby and he was happy being close dad/mom feeling the warmth.I would recomend this product to anyone.JT",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","When I first got this product, I was happy to see how sturdy it was.  Other carriers that I have looked at were made very cheaply and did not feel that it would be entirely sturdy to hold a baby.  With this classic carrier, I am confident that it will hold a baby securly and comfortable.  Will definitely recommend.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","Comfortable, convenient, easy to use. This is the only way I can grocery shop as my daughter loves it! It was the best present to myself.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","Babybjorn lives up to its name. This carrier is very baby-friendly and my 5 week-old infant sleeps soundly in it every time. The head gear helps her neck to be stable during her crankiest moods and my mother feels proud to flash this nicely designed carrier when we are at a mall. It took us a minute to figure out how to put the carrier on but after a moment, it's a cinch. It is well-constructed and the details are good. The only puzzling parts are how to put this whole package back into the little net that they provide for storage (we simply gave up and decided to store it in a huge babybag) And the only other drawback I foresee is that my infant will probably grow out of this after five or six more months (she only weight 9 pounds now). My nephew who was a huge baby grew out of this in his sixth month (at 22 pounds). I wonder if there is a way to make the carrier last a little longer by providing extra inserts for our ever-expanding babies. It's a pricy investment to make for only a five or six months use. Otherwise this is the purchase for you if you want a sturdy, well-designed carrier. I'm not sure how breathable this new carrier air is but it at least looks cooler than my nephew's original bjorn carrier.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Black, ClassicAfter seeing some other baby carriers, I found the BabyBjorn more suited toward my preference.  It's really light and sturdy, ideal for my son.  I was thinking about getting a newer model, but the classic model does the same function for far less cost. I found the instruction easy to follow and was wearing it right away.  It is also good to have your spouse adjust the straps for you since I'm a big guy.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","This did take some getting use to, for both me & the baby. I recommend starting off slow (1st time for about 15 min. and gradually increase) until you and the baby become comfortable. Its a great tool and big help in not having to constantly ""hold"" your baby on your own. We love it.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I recently received the original black babybjorn carrier as a gift for the birth of our third child.  With our first 2 sons we had a Snugli baby carrier that rarely got used due to the difficult to use design.  The Babybjorn is so easy to use!! It's ""backpack"" design makes it simple and intuitive to use. The clips fit snug with no worry of baby falling out or difficulty getting her in.  I have not experienced any back pain, however, my daughter is less than 3 months old.  I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for a safe, comfortable carrier.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I just received my new Baby Bjorn Air for my newborn.  The product is easy to assemble and will fit a newborn slightly under 8lbs easy.  So far so good, I can't wait to have both hands free so I can get more accomplished during the day.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","We have used our Baby Bjorn almost every day since our baby was born.  There have been many times when it's the only way we can get her to fall asleep.  She loves it, particularly the forward facing view, which we've been using since she's been about 3 months.  She just loves having a view of everything and kicks in happiness when she's in it.  It's so easy to put on and super easy to put the baby in.  It's easily adjustable (when my husband or I trade off).  It's sturdy and easily washable without any fading or damaging of the material when washed.  My only complaint is that my baby is no 7 months, about 19 pounds and about 27 inches and the top shoulder snaps are almost not closing any more when she has on a thick sweater.  In addition, my back and shoulders hurt now after carrying her for a little while because the original had no waist/hip support strap.  But, I still love it.  We'll just have to get a different carrier now that's she's too large for it.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My baby is comfortable in it , no issues what so everWashed it few times and still has a brand new look",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",The babybjorn is awesome. It makes life with a newborn so much easier. It's much lighter and convenient than carrying a carseat everywhere.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My little one is 6 weeks old and I have been struggling with simple house chores as she wants to be held all the time.  I finally researched and purchased this carrier.  It is so easy to put on and it feels very secure and sits well.  I am very tiny myself and I was concerned about how it would sit.  The cons are that it generates a lot of heat between the baby, the carrier and myself, so I would not recommend using it for long periods.  The other thing is that since the baby sits in front, it is not easy to do things like eat unless you turn sideways.  All in all, however, it is a great carrier that my husband and I can use for a while.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",My daughter is comfortable in it and often falls asleep. Easy to put on and adjust.  Allows me to have my hands free and she is able to interact with surroundings better than if I was holding her.  No more sore back from baby totting.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I have been wanting to purchase the baby bjorn,and finally ,we did!! It is very comfortable to wear and our baby loves it.

Not comfortable,it had no support like this one does.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","Pros- An extremely nice product. comfortable for the parents (both my wife and I use it) and for our daughter. easy to adjust (although we are of similar body sizes) to put on and take off.Cons- wearing in the summer, it can get uncomfortably warm. in a somewhat hotter climate (we live in northern CA) I would consider the Air version.",5,1

I am able to continue to do housework, etc while still keeping her close and content.  I would recommend this product to anyone.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I have been using Ergo since my son was born. My husband also wants to carry our baby, and we are totally different shape, so it was too much work to fit everytime for two people. so we decided to buy another carrier, Baby Bjorn.

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",this is a must buy for al the mommies ..yes it is expensive but it beats all the comparison ...its way more comfortable and sturdy than any of its competitors ... i loved it...,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I've made the mistake of spoiling my son by holding him too much. He rarely wants to sit alone especially when he knows that I'm in the room. The BabyBJorn makes him feel as if I'm holding him while I can clean around the house and study.  He loves it and always cracks a smile whenever I strap him in. I would definitely recommend this carrier to anyone looking for one.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I purchased this product for a very long plane ride from Chicago to Tokyo.  My son was two months old at the time and it was a life saver.  It allowed me to have my hands free.  Not to mention the money we saved not having to buy an extra seat.  I thought that I would just use it for the trip but now I use it to go to shopping and to the grocery store.  The most importantly my son loves it.,5,1
Kolcraft Choo Choo Trainer All Aboard Potty Seat,"I bought this for my 20 month old son and we both love it.  I haven't tried any other pottys so I don't know if he prefers this over something else, but I know that this potty is easy for him to get on and off, he can get comfortable easily and he loves the encouraging sounds that the potty makes.  I like it because it is easy to take apart and reassemble to clean, we can use it on the regular toilet when it is time, it converts to a stepstool, and the stepstool top fits underneath the potty when it's not in use, so I don't have to look for a seperate place to store it.  The only thing I would change would be for the deflector shield not to come off so easily.  One thing my son loves to do is take it off as soon as he sits down.  But other than that, I'm really satisfied!",5,1
Chicco KeyFit 22 Cortina Travel System Sahara,"We first got the Eddie Bauer Mercer system. It was awful.  We couldn't believe how unsafe the car seat was!  We took it back and got this system.  We love it!  It seems so safe, comfortable and stylish!  After reading all the other reviews, I am sure that our baby will love it too once she gets here!",5,1
"North States Metal Supergate Auto Close Gate, 2 Bar Extension",It works great.  Closes automatically and fits an odd area above our stairs.  Good for keeping our puppy out of the basement until we are ready.,5,1
"Shermag Glider Rocker, Natural","So far this chair has worked out great! The seat is very comfortable and the gliding motion is very smooth. You don't need to put out much effort to rock in the glider and the foot stool makes it even easier to glide. The chair arrived sooner than I thought and the chair was not damaged and the color of the wood was very true to what the picute indicates. It took 30 minutes to put it together -  we had an issue with the arm cushions ;). I would highly recommend this chair for anyone who is looking for a glider for his or her nursery. The only down sides to the chair are the seat is not wide enough to fit you, the baby, and a boppy pillow comfortably (for those moms who will brest feed); the cream colored cushions are getting dirty faster than I thought, and if you are sitting close to the edge of the seat DO NOT LEAN FORWARD!! I made the mistake of leaning forward - my little one and I went overboard!  Other than that, the chair meets all of my requirements and I would tell others to buy this chair. Especially at the price - you can't beat it. You don't need to pay top dollar to get top quality.",4,1
Thinkativity: Little Storyteller,"So far, my 17 month old daughter has not shown that much interest in it, but that is not the toy's fault-she likes to grab her favorite real books and sit in our laps and have us read to her.  But I think that she will grow into it over the next few months.  I myself like the idea-she can sit and create her own stories while I get stuff done around the house, or perhaps while she is in the car seat (now that I've thought of it, I'll try that).",4,1
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess",I love all of these first years insulated cups - they're the only cups Iv'e had that don't spill... don't know what to say about those reviews... maybe they are so careful about cleaning the holes that they enlarge them... people - those little flaps inside the nipple are soft rubber - just clean on either side don't stick things through the hole!Only complaint i have with specifically the CARS version of the cups is that the pictures peel or wear of with time. The other prints have gone through all kinds of washing and still look new. The cars print not so much...,4,1

"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","These cups are the only brand on the market that are completely spill proof.  We have tested all of them!  The best feature is that these cups do not have any attachments-just the lid and cup.  The only problem with them is that they are very hard to suck from.  We tried them at 1, and our son couldn't get much from them.  We had to switch back to the leaky Playtex with the plastic plugs.  At 15 mths, we're still waiting to use them.",4,1
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","As a mom of 6 years, I've tried them all. Here is what it boils down to: 1) how easy are the cups to clean and 2) do they leak. Unlike most other cups,  these have no extra ""parts"" (valves), so you have the basics to clean (and potentially lose)...the lid and the cup. Unlike the gazillion of other cups I have which are rendered useless because the little valve gets lost,  you can't find the right valve for the right cup (think tupperware lid issue here...), these cups are the BEST for ease of use. One lid, one cup...interchangeable. You're done. My kids have used them from ages 2 through 5 and still going strong. I have only had leaking issues when the cups get old (one year +). Find a kitchen brush that has the small, stiff bristols on the end like the plastic ones on this site or the Michael Graves ones and use those for the inner rim. Don't put them in the dishwasher and you should be good to go. I've never had one which was defective from day one and I've purchased no less than 20 of these. BPA free. Love them and gave away the other styles after discovering these.",5,1
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess",The beauty of The FIrst Years Sippy cups is they do not have a valve but instead rely on a small rubberized hole on top of the lid to regulate the flow. No valve to lose or go bad. Much easier to wash and sanitize. I could not be happier,5,1

"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","My son loves SwaddleMe products! He's a little more than a month old and he's been using them for 3-4 weeks now. I bought this for him because it was going to be cooler where we live. It's not too heavy but keeps him nice and warm. SwaddleMe is soft and cozy. All of the SwaddleMe Products help him sleep easier and I will admit that they've 100% helped me and my husband sleep at night. Once he's in his ""baby straight jacket"" he sleeps at least 4 hours a night, sometimes up to 6! So easy to use too! There is a video a person made on youtube if you have no idea how to put it on baby. Great investment!",5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","I love these super soft, snuggly wraps! My son is  3.5 months old and 16 pounds. It fits him fine now, but I don't think he'll fit in it for very long. My son sleeps so much better swaddled, however he started wiggling out of even our large Aden & Anais muslin swaddle blankets. I was so hopeful that I would be able to snug it enough to keeps his arms in. No such luck! I honestly think it is a combination of our wiggly, strong baby and the fabric being just stretchy enough. For the most part, it works out because his arms are still down when he falls asleep. 5-6 hours later though, at least one arm is out and he's awake! I just pray he'll grow out of swaddling soon!Pros:-Soft, warm-Easy to put onCons:-A little more growing room would be nice-Not secure enough for Houdini babiesMake sure shoulders are in the little shoulder pockets to keep it as snug as possible!",4,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",I have purchased a few of these swaddle wraps but prefer the cotton material rather than the microfleece material but they are still a great product.I have been using these wraps for 5 months now and they are fantastic.  My bubs is 11 months old and he is a tall boy and yet they still fit him (although not for much longer).  In winter I wrap him with a muslin wrap underneath and then with this wrap and he stays super warm.  It is summer in Australia now so I use just the swaddle wrap now and its perfect.  Most nights he stays wrapped the entire night but he can wiggle his arms out if he wants which is fine at this age because if he turns onto his stomach he can use his arms to turn over again.,5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",My son would not sleep without this!!!!!!!!!!!

"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",This is a great product for helping infants to sleep in cool/cold weather! I like the fleece ones since they aren't as stretchy (and escapable) as the knit swaddlers and they are toasty warm. We used one of these fleece swaddlers almost nightly from month 2-month 4 to help our daughter sleep.,5,1
Baby Einstein Discovering Water Rocker Seat,"This is definitely something you'll get many years of use out of.  Great design, & wonderful bells & whistles.  Our 4 month old loves it and will be able to use it for many years to come (unlike any of the other bouncers)  It is a bit larger than other bouncers, but for good reason.  We own 2 other bouncers that only go to 15-20 pounds and they went into the closet after 7 months, never to return.  This piece can serve as a toddler/tv chair for atleast 4 years.  You can't go wrong.",5,1
Boppy Newborn Lounger,"I ordered this on amazon before my baby was even born.  Once it arrived I started to wonder why I ordered it and what on earth I'd do with it.  It has turned out to be an absolute lifesaver.  She LOVES this thing, my husband and I could not do without it.  She fits in it perfectly and has since she was born.  She is now 9 weeks old and still using it day in and day out.  I'm very safety conscious but I let her sleep in it (for naps only) because I cannot for the life of me figure out why not.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they are just putting warnings on it for liability sake.  It is also PERFECT for taking to other people's houses and letting her lay on it while we are there, because it is so portable.  The only thing I wish I had known was that they make a cover for it because you cannot put the lounger in the washing machine.  I highly recommend the cover for it because if your baby blows out diaper you've got a real mess on your hands.  Trust me. LOL",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,We bought this for my sister as a gift after she saw how thoroughly we enjoyed ours at various parks last summer. It's a great mat for keeping clean and dry while sitting / playing on the ground. It folds easily and the built in carry strap is fantastic.,5,1

JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I bought this since I got tired of having a wet bottom after sitting on a regular blanket or towel on the wet grass. And it's great! It's large enough for a few people to sit on it. I use it with my baby, and it's easy to wipe clean. The material is sort of shiny. The color is a bit off from the photo, but quite nice. I bought the gray/green, and the outside is more of a lighter green than the photo, with green, gray, brown and orange on the inside. It's a bit heavier and bigger folded up than I expected, but I can still carry it pretty easily. The strap is nice, and it folds quite easily. It's much thicker than a blanket, and provides a nice surface outside, whether on grass or something else.",5,1

I'm so glad to have this blanket handy.",5,1

I had another blanket with a handle and the underside was flannel and it was HOT to sit on. This one is perfect. I would just say the picture of the people sitting on it is a little deceiving, as you can probably only fit one adult and a child or two OR two adults comfortably. Not the whole family.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I ordered one for myself a while a go, and I LOVE IT!!This one was a baby shower gift &#8230;.. my friend LOVE it, as I did.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,It does everything it advertises PLUS you can wash it in the washing machine for after use to ensure that it stays clean for your next trip!,5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"How did I not think to register for one of these?  This is an absolute must-have for anyone who wants to be outside with their baby...or anyone!  Perfect for the park, beach, backyard, and I even use it in the house on our hardwoods.  It's great because it isn't bulky and folds up nicely, so it's easy to put in the bottom of a stroller or just carry on your shoulder.  And the fact it can be used by anyone of any age, it's a great product to just have on hand.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,I take this with us every time we go on a trip to the coast. It is perfect for sitting or laying on for the beach. Never lets the dampness of the wet sand through and is a lot more comfortable than a towel any day.,5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"We used this all the past summer, it was very convenient to carry to Central Park, it looks pretty, is durable.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I purchased this blanket to use with my 6 month old outside in the grass and as a travel blanket for the beach.  The blanket did have a strong smell when we got it and I had to leave it out and open for about a week but the smell faded and now there is no smell at all (about 3 months later with moderate use). It is very handy, a decent size and easy to clean minor spills and messes by wiping the surface. The only downfall was that we needed to wait a while to use it until the smell faded. It reminded me of a new plastic shower curtain smell only not as stong. Now we love the blanket and use it in our yard almost every day. It provides a great place to put the baby so she is not directly on the grass (although now she often crawls off the blanket but thats not the blankets fault).",4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"Give as a gift, and the mom to be loved it",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"We've used this blanket a lot in the short time we've had it. It has served us well for picnics and also for a place for my infant son to play without getting wet or dirty.  It wipes clean easily and packs up nicely.  The only design flaw is the velcro on the outside of it for keeping it put together... When the blanket is spread out on the ground the velcro faces the ground and gets seeds and other ground crap embedded in it.  I cannot think of a better solution that would keep the blanket convenient and one-hand-usable (other hand holding a baby) like the velcro, but picking out seeds and such is annoying.  Despite that, we are glad we have it and everything else has lived up to the product description.",4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,I bought this after our own picinic type blanket kept soaking through with morning dew or grass that had been rained on the day before.This blanket doesn't have that problem. But I'd say it is a bit on the small side. My other blankets fit 2 adults and a couple of young kids easily. This one really only fits 1 adult and 1 kid (maybe 2 kids) without having to cram together.Folds easily though. Might just buy 2 to solve the size problem.,4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"This blanket, with its felt side and waterproof opposite side, is perfect for family picnics, lawn concerts or even outdoor events in bad weather when it can be used as a stadium blanket.  Folds itself into a large hanging  bag with shoulder strap.  Perfect for 2 adults, 2 kids and accompanying gear.JJ Cole Collections All-Purpose Blanket, Gray/Green",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,This was just what I was looking for to give to a cross country runner for Christmas. It is fabric on the top side where the young teens will sit while at the same time vinyl on the ground side so that it keeps moisture off of runner waiting to compete,5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,Made for a parent!This is super easier to fold up and carry - a necessary feature for a parent who is already carrying 10 other items :),5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"Great for beach, outdoor festivals, park etc. wAterproof and easily to fold back into carrying case. Wish the outside pocket had a snap or Velcro to actually be functional.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,I purchased this blanket after seeing another mommy friend pull hers out.  It is great - throw it down on the dirt and then into the washer.  It folds up nicely and has a strap that you can hook onto the stroller or throw over your arm like a purse. I have received a lot of compliments on it. I leave it in the car so that I always have something to put down on the ground in the event we go somewhere unexpected. It's very attractive and a great gift for any mom.,5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I keep this in the back of the car or in the stroller since we travel a lot and it has already withstood some serious abuse from my toddler and infant. I love how soft it is for my infant to roll around, crawl or nap on. It's super to just shake off the dirt or wipe it down whether it's food or dirt! It's a great quality blanket and I feel it will last a good while. The only thing is I wish it was a little more padded but then I suppose it wouldn't be so compact. ;) I always throw down a small cushy blanket when the baby naps on it anyways. For most people it should more than sufficient. So glad I got this!",4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"Let me start by saying I'm not normally a comparison shopper.  This situation just presented itself to me in a strange internet-glitch type way.  When I do make a purchase, I do like to mildly compare before a purchase.  So when I was shopping for an outdoor blanket, after looking through various outdoor blankets, I was convinced that the Skip Hop blanket was the one for me.  However, according to Amazon, it would take several months for me to receive it because they were backordered.  I ended up making an order with Babies R Us.....which was later backordered.  It was close to soccer season and I needed one right away so I ordered the JJ Cole blanket because it could be delivered within a week.  I've been using the JJ Cole blanket for over a month now and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's very easy to roll out and when it's time to go, roll back up.  The quality is excellent.  Well, Monday afternoon, the Skip Hop outdoor blanket showed up on my doorstep and I took it to soccer practice to try it out.  Not too impressed.  The cooler bag that goes with it is teeny-tiny and you can't fit much in it.  The zipper makes it more difficult to lay out and fold back up and if you have a baby in your arms, it makes it that much more difficult.  The JJ Cole blanket is cheaper in price and better in quality and it's much easier to use.  I highly recommend it and I get tons of compliments on it.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"This blanket is worth getting. It doesn't absorb water easily which makes it convenient for when the grass is wet or humid and it folds nicely into a compact rectangle, making it easy to keep in your car. It is easy to clean too as the grass and mud doesn't stick to it. Just remember 5ft x 5ft is much more small than you would think. I wish I had gotten a bigger one.",4,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",Wonderful product... My little girl will be soo comfy and cozy on the go!..Love the fact that its waterproof! Fits prefect in my infant carrier!,5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","I got this for my 2-month-old and it has been great.  It is warm enough that we don't have to bundle our little guy up to the point where he's smothered when we're taking him from place to place.  The fit isn't perfect, but it does what it says it does.",5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",Very nice quality! My daughter use it every day! And I would like to recommend this to my friends! Love it,5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",I bought this for my son when he was born back in 2008. I loved it so much that I bought a second one when my daughter was born in September last year. Super toasty and looks sharp too without the bulky jackets and coats.,5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","Our 18 mo old hates wearing winter coats.  We weren't sure she would tolerate the Bundleme, but she seems to have connected the fact that it keeps her warm and when she is warm she is more comfortable. We live in the city so we walk a lot and since she is more comfortable in the stroller, the walks are much nicer (she would get cranky when she was cold probably not even realizing that was the problem - she won't wear hats or mittens either!).  So the Bundleme has been great for us..",5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","I live in a region where it can get really cold in the winter. I wanted something to use on top of snowsuits or winter coats that would not be too bulky. For this use, I'm very satisfied. I use it with my umbrella stroller, however it doesn't fit my Baby Jogger - City Mini stroller. The bundle needs to be secured at the top of the seat with an elastic that goes around the backrest. Therefore, it is not completely universal fit. I am however happy with this product and would recommend it.",5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",This is great for stroller rides in the winter!  It fits my Graco stroller with just a little creativity and stay in place very well!  It keeps my 18 month old nice and warm in the cold Northeast!,5,1
"JL Childress MaxiCOOL 4 Bottle Cooler, Black",Buy it with the ice packs from j.l. childress.They work good hand-in-hand. You can also put some pocket tissue packs on the outer sleeve.,5,1
"JL Childress Tall TwoCOOL 2 Bottle Cooler, Black",I use this all the time-- I can fit a cooler pack and several 5 oz. bottles of milk in this bag and it is still small enough to carry around in my diaper bag. I never have to worry about being unprepared when my baby decides he needs to eat while we are on the go!,5,1
"JL Childress Tall TwoCOOL 2 Bottle Cooler, Black",i have no problem with this product. it is what it says it is. keeps my milk cool and fresh. came with an ice pack,5,1
Second Nature 4oz  Nurser - 3pk,"FYI. I love these nipples, the milk only comes out when baby is sucking. Anyone who wants to try but is afraid of investing here is a trick: the nipples fit into the Advent bottles! We had a lot of Advent bottles given to us by friends, but I really didnt like them, so I bought one Second Nature bottle to try and I loved it, not wanting to waste the bottles I already had, I tried the nipple in the Advent bottle and it worked, no leaks either!! Just wanted to share",4,1
Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor with Dual Receivers - White and Grey,"We love this! We had read reviews prior to purchasing that complained of cross-connections, but we have not experienced that since there are so many channels. Works so well and has red lights for the visual checks as well as the audio checks on the baby. Wonderful and easy to use!",5,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We just had our first child and bought this monitor cause the 900 mhz fischer price monitor had very poor reception and a lot of static.. This monitor is everything you would want in a monitor. Cristal clear reception, You can hear baby perfectly!!The unit has rechargeable batteries which is a big plus for me. All in all I highly recommend this monitor. It will be what you were expecting!!!",5,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We are very pleased with this monitor - and yes I believe a monitor is a must-have baby product - you will know right away when your baby cries if you put them down for a nap or down for the night and want to be another room.  The sound quality is good with this device - and we have wireless internet and live in a densely populated neighborhood.  Also, I was pleasantly suprised by the small size of both the sound monitor and the receivers.  The receiver in my kitchen takes up very little counter space, and the monitor is small enough to keep on a window sill.  I appreciate another's reviewer suggestion to get the monitor with 2 receivers (not one) if you live in a 2-story house.  I was going to buy the single receiver model, but I am glad we didn't, as I can keep one receiver upstairs in our bedroom and the other downstairs in our kitchen.  I have often taken one of the receivers outside to do some work in our backyard while our little one naps - and have been able to get work done all the while being able to respond to our baby quickly when he cries.  Overall, great product.",5,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We bought a regular monitor for our first child three years ago and we loved it at the time, but now we have a new house and a heat pump between us and the kid's rooms so we get a lot of interference.  The new iMonitor gives us crystal clear reception and a huge 2000 ft range which lets me mow the lawn while I watch for the lights to flicker.  One piece of advice: the battery is not connected, so when you charge for the first time remember to open the battery compartment and connect it.  I left one of mine unconnected because its always plugged in next to the bed.  I can save the battery for the one I use for roaming.",5,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"I got this because it's supposed to have a 2000 ft range. I think maybe it does with no walls, wind, obstructions, noise etc. between the base and the monitor. It does work most of the time though and honestly every single monitor I've ever owned has been the same in that area. This one has really good features:** 100% Digital technology. ((Not as clear as they claim, BUT I have never picked up anyone else's phone conversations or other baby moniters. Yes this has happened to me in the past. FREAKY.))** Up to a 2000-foot range. ((See above))** Rechargeable batteries. ((VERY HANDY!!))** Docking stations to recharge parent units. ((If you can remember to put them back, this is useful!))** Parent unit finder. ((Only works if unit turned on & has battery power))** Out-of-range alarm. ((VERY USEFUL))** Child unit battery back-up for peace of mind. ((LOVE the fact that they run on reg batteries and also can be recharged!))** Soundlights for visual connection to baby.  ((REALLY like this))** Two parent units so you can monitor baby from two locations. ((We use BOTH units all the time))",4,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We bought this monitor after having our third child and moving to a new neighborhood.  Our old monitor worked well but picked up our neighbors' monitors and conversations.  The design is excellent, very small and portable, and it drops into a charging cradle like a cordless phone, so nothing to plug in.  Since two parent units (and chargers) are included, we leave one upstairs and one downstairs - a great convenience eliminating the need to tote one unit back and forth.  Even though our house is chock full of cordless phones and has a wireless computer network, we have virtually no static or interference of any kind, and the monitor picks up every sound with great clarity.  It has a few minor drawbacks, though.  Light sleepers will find that the lowest volume setting is not low enough in comparison to other monitors, making the baby's every move sound very loud in the middle of the night.  The battery time, while acceptable, could be better (and is noticeably less than our prior monitor).  Also, the LED lights are bright and may keep some people awake at night (and may contribute to battery drain when off the charging cradle).  All in all, though, this is a great monitor and I recommend it highly.",4,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"After going through 4 different monitors, my husband and I both love this one and have returned or ""regifted"" the others. We can bring it outside without any interference (which we got with other monitors) The sound is very clear, in fact we have turned down the monitor we use in the bedroom. Other reviews mentioned that the on/off switch was easy to accidentally bump, but we have not noticed that. I also have not had any issues with malfunctioning and we use it everyday, all night long. Finally the monitor battle in our house has come to an end!",4,1
Summer Infant Newborn-to-Toddler Fold Away Baby Bath - Blue,I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it!  The attached soap compartment is something every new mother needs!,5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"Like the head cushion...lots of room in tub, however tub itself is very big and takes up a lot of space.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"I love this bathtub! The hammock made it really easy for our newborn. Now that he's 4 month old, we're using it only attached to one side.  He doesn't slip and I can't wait until he can sit in the wider end of the tub and can enjoy the little ""cups"" and splash.  I liked the tub so much I gave it already as a Shower Gift.One con, the bump, because it's not placed very great in the tub, so that he sits very high, which makes washing the hair a bit harder.  If he lies down, the bump sticks in his back, but it's manageable.  Tub on the wider end is bigger than other tubs though, which is a plus.",4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,I like this bathtub because I didn't have to worry about my baby sliding into the water without me holding her up when she was really little. The sling did a great job of making bathing simple when she was small. My only complaint is that there is little room around the sling to get your hand in to get some water on a facecloth or in a cup. Once my daughter was old enough to sit up we went right to a bath seat and did not use the deeper part of this tub.,4,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!!  She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her.  She really enjoys bathtime.  And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby...  you will really enjoy it.  I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her.  After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place.  Caution:  Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size.  This tub is perfect if you do that!  The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use.  Please read the directions.  Both you and your child will appreciate that you did!",5,1
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Tan",I think it's great to have an extra base- much easier to swap kids and cars.  We just appreciated the convenience.,5,1
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Tan",The extra base for additional cars is a must have with the infant carrier.  It makes putting the carseT in and taking it out a breeze.  I often see people in a store with the base still attached to the seat - makes me wonder.,5,1
Mini Steps - Magical Music Cube,"My both sons (10 month and 2,5 years) love it.Would buy it again....",5,1
Summer Infant Three-In-One Family Thermometer,"Ok...I've went through about 5 to 8 thermometers in 2.5 years, attempting to find one that wasn't junk.  I've tried them all.  Ear, rectal, forehead, oral, underarm.  This is GREAT!  Enough said...BUY IT!  Trust me, I've been a pediatric nurse for 20 years, this is an excellent thermometer without spending $200, which was my next step.",5,1

Triumph Premier Convertible Car Seat - Stonehenge,"I was going to suck up the cost and buy two Britax seats for our 10-month-old twin girls, but then a good friend told me about how great and safe these Evenflo Triumph seats are.  I haven't had any problems with the straps, installation, cleaning, recline, or babys' heads falling forward (we use phone books underneath).  The girls seem very comfortable.These seats worked so well for us that I bought two more for my husband's car.  We got four seats for the price of two Britax seats.  The only thing you don't get is the snob-appeal.",5,1
Triumph Premier Convertible Car Seat - Stonehenge,"I've noticed a few people stating that they had their car seats ""professionally installed.""  Well, the teen boy working part time at the Babies R Us is not considered a professional car seat installer.  Take the seat to your State Troopers!  They have to show you the proper installation!",5,1
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,"Love these nipples because they are a great shape and size.  I love that they have slow, medium, fast instead of just slow and fast.  One note on these is I normally hand wash but decided to put them in the dishwasher once because I thought it would be good to give them that high heat sanitation.  The dishwasher turned them this awful yellowish brown color.  So I don't recommend putting them in the dishwasher.  Otherwise a great product.",5,1
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,I love the playtex Ventaire bottles but since my 1 year old is still on bottles i haven't yet opened the replacement nipples (those are for the baby due in 4 months)!,4,1
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,There isn't much to say about these nipples.  They fit the bottles they are supposed to and do the job they claim to do.,5,1
"Playtex Ventaire Bubble Free Silicone Feeding Nipples, Stage 2 Fast Flow  - 2 Pack","I bought these to fit all of my medela bottles since my daughter wanted faster flow nipples and medela does not make any (yet). They fit perfectly with the regular bottle ring/cuffs. I did have a few bottles (medela) that had a extra wide cuff, which these did not fit, but that's ok since it's a lot easier to clean/reuse cuffs than clean nipples. My daughter was much happier with the faster flow (needed the switch at 4.5 mo).",5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,We use the playtex dropin nursers for our daughter who is mostly breast fed. When we first started trying to give her a bottle she seemed interested then spit it out and had a cow.  About this time a friend passed all her bottles and nipples on to us and in that stash was one of these. We were desperate so we sterilized it and tried it. She took it right away without a fuss. I don't know if it's because  this feels more like skin than the silicone or if it is because these have a textured ring around them that the silicone ones lack. Either way our picky breast fed baby takes and loves these things.,5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,"Great for spare parts for vintage baby bottle collection.  These were purchased to complete nippleless bottles I got for my collection (hey, some folks collect fishing lures, salt/pepper shakers, rocks, shoes&#8230;. there are more bottle collectors than one might think !!). Playtex is a reliable brand, and latex is the authentic material for many bottles.",5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,Getting a breast fed baby to take a bottle for the first time is not easy. Our little one seemed to latch on to these better Than the clear ones I think they are a little softer.  They arrived very quickly and packaged good.,5,1
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,"These are the only nipple I was finally able to get my daughter to drink out of her bottle. However, it's not the same as the one you buy at the store. These are a little firmer. I purchased them because I could not find any here but after buying some locally they are different and my daughter prefers the locally bought one over this one but I still use it since I have it and it works with a little bit more effort.",4,1
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,"I have used this product for over five years and it has been through three vehicles and still holding up.  It is starting to show a little wear so I am purchasing new ones.  I strongly disagree with the previous reviews on the quality, unless your child is an animal or monster, these will work for you perfectly.",5,1
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,"It works good and was easy to install.  The pocket is pretty small, but that's more of a bonus to not having a dirty seat, the main reason to buy the product!",4,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),"I really like this bottles especially because you can freeze them and they are reusable.  The size is about right since most breastfed kids will eat around 3oz per feeding for a long time.  The only problem when compared to the plastic liner bags is that these are very bulky and can occupy half of your freezer very quickly if you're trying to build up a month's supply stock.  If you are hoping to keep a month's supply or less frozen they are a great alternative, otherwise probably the plastic liner bags are easier to handle.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),"I use these with my Medela pump in style advanced with no issues whatsoever. I love them better then the bags, they are easier to store in my opinion, they don't leak, easy to thaw, easy to heat in a bottle warmer. They are the perfect 2 oz size for my newborn baby who takes between 2-4 oz per feeding. I have bought 2 boxes to keep me going for a while.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),I love that they can be washed & resued unlike bags which are a one-time use.  I also love that you can add more milk (un-like a bag).  The size is perfect and they store great.,5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),It's made of good quality hard plastic that is sure to withstand multiple usage. You can store it in the freezer and the quality of the milk is not affected. You can even use it to store pills when traveling.,5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),"These work well if you are pumping smaller volumes. Often, though, I pump more than 4 oz so I use bags instead. Also, if one side produces more than the other, it can be annoying because one side will fill up and there's still room on the other side for more. Tends to be easier to just pump into the bottles that come with the pump and dump it all into a storage bag. I use the Lansinoh storage bags, which are great (I haven't tried another brand yet). So, if you are pumping small volumes, these work just fine.",4,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),The Medela breastmilk containers are really convenient! I use them to carry pre-measured powdered formula in my diaper bag for on the go bottles and also for pumping when I know that I'm not going to get much milk (like right after nursing). I really like that they come pre-sterilized so I don't have to boil them before using. Great little back-up containers!,5,1

"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I don't write a lot of reviews, but I'm so impressed already with this product that I had to log on. I received and assembled my Joovy stroller today and I'm quite happy.  It was easy to assemble and seems very sturdy.  My Evenflo carseat fits great with it as my son is only 1 month old and obviously too small for the front seat yet.  My 2 year old instantly jumped on and loves both the sit and the stand options, and we'll be heading outside to test it when she wakes from her nap.  It looks good, it folds compactly, and I'm really happy with the value.  I will say that folded up, it's a tad heavy but that's what you expect from a durable double stroller.  It isn't too heavy to move in and out of the car, just heavier than my mostly plastic stroller.Once it's been put in practice this weekend, I'll write more.  But at first glance, I'm impressed and VERY happy with my purchase.",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I would highly recommend this stroller.  It is easy to assemble, and use.  The car seat adapter has allowed me to get my 3 month old and 3 year old out of the house with ease.  Great for walks, parks and shopping trips.  It manuevers easily.  The only draw back is that the stroller is a bit heavy.  I can still get it in and out of the car, but it is heavy.  Overall a fabulous product.  A great alternative to a bulky doubble stroller.",4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","Love this stroller! Best thing for my two boys! My oldest is 3, youngest is 10 months and it couldnt be more perfect! Pleasantly surprised with every detail!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","We have had this stroller for about six months and is has been a life saver.  My husband is currently away on a military assignment and I have to manage the kids by myself.  The eight month old loves to be able to sit and have a tray for toys.  There are two cup holders on his tray so one can be used for him and one for his brother.  My three year old loves all the options this stroller gives him.  He can sit, stand or hold on to the bar and walk beside it.  In fact all I have to do to get him back in the stroller is to say he will be strapped in if he doesn't come.  It is very important when they stand on the back to have them hold on to the handles and have the support strap up.  The basket is hard to get to but I use my son to get things in and out of it.  He feels very important doing that.  I appreciate the independence my son is learning and at the same time the control I have to keep him safe.  The zoo has never been so easy and fun... not to mention shopping.",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I have a 4 year old and a 6 month old. The tandem stroller works well when I have to take both of them out together to a place (Like a mall) that requires some walking. The 4 year old seems to like it! The downside is that it is heavy and clunky and hard for me to get in out of my SUV. Also, my little one is still in her infant seat, so when my older one wants to sit in the back seat, it is on a slant and not comfortable for him. Once she is sitting in the regular stroller seat, he will be more comfortable. Also there is little basket space underneath and no cup holder for her bottle. I'm still glad I bought it!",4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I got this stroller because I was traveling with a 2 year old and a 6 month old...it worked great! Never had any issues with it. There could be a little more storage, but I'm not going to let that be something that makes me dislike the stroller. I put stuff in the basket before my 2 year old sat down and it worked just fine!! I would reccommend this stroller!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I can fit it in my Mazda 5, my kids love sitting in it, the only small complaint I have is that the back seat moves around when my kid is sitting on it. I wish it locked into place but I love the fact that it does move out of the way to get into the storage basket. This stroller turns way better than the other sit and stand I owned. It is heavy but I think it  was half the price of the joovy ultralight, and I'm used to carrying kids around so I can handle lifting it into the car. I have no regrets buying this stroller, it's a good stroller to own.",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",i bought this stroller earlier this year so i could go for walks with my two  younger children. a 2 and a 5 year old. and i love it. my daughter is tall but she fit in the front just fine and my son just love that he could stand up or sit down. he would go back and forth while the stroller was in motion and its great when we are out all day and he gets tired of walking. i would definetly recommend this stroller to anyone with smaller children. i even used it to do my workout walks and it worked great. dont hesitate to get this stroller.,5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I bought this because of the sale price but ended up loving it!  I have a newborn and a 2 1/2 year old, so this works perfect because I can put the infant carseat on the front.  My 2 year old loves the option of standing or sitting, and since he likes to constantly get off and on, this is so much easier than a traditional double stroller where I'd have to lift him in and out.  It's a little heavy and a little more challenging to maneuver (due to the extra length), but I imagine any double stroller would be that way.  I don't use this every day because my 2 year old doesn't need to ride very often, but when we go to the zoo, mall, or anywhere else we'll be walking a lot, this is exactly what I needed.  The only thing missing is a cup holder for me!  They sell add-on ones, but they were too pricy in my opinion.",4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","A little lighter than my other double stroller, it's great cause the baby can see his surroundings and my middle one can either sit or stand and it's not taking me 20 mins to get to the corner. Great price, it's doing what I need it to do for now :)",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I have (soon to be) 7 daughters. The youngest are age 3 and 17 months (and I'm due again in 2 months). This stroller is great. It gives my independent 3 year old the option to sit or stand and she loves it. She likes riding on the grocery cart the same way so this stroller seemed to be perfect. We liked it so much that I purchased the triple stroller from E bay (used). I'm sure we will get tons of use out of it as well. I like that it holds the carseat with no fuss and another child can still ride comfortably. I will definitely recommend this stroller to anyone with more than one child under the age of 5/6 and the triple if you have a litter like I do! It is well worth the price.,5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","This stroller has been a big hit with both mom and toddler for us!  It's better than I thought it would be when I saw it online!  What attracted me to the stroller initially was that the seat had a 5 point harness, a seat in the back for my 3 year old to sit or stand, a storage basket underneath and a snack/drink tray for the youngest in the front.  My in-laws gave this to my husband and myself as a gift (we're expecting baby #3 any day now)!  Once the stroller was here and we put it together which by the way took only 5 minutes and I was able to do it myself it had soooo many more features than I had expected.  There's a nice little mesh bag on the back of the front seat and the height handle of the bar is perfect (most stroller bars are so low you actually are hunched over to push the stroller), and BEST of all is that there is a seat belt on the back seat so that the oldest child can still be buckled in (great when you have a wild child like mine!).  The back seat has PLENTY of room even with the infant car seat on the front (which by the way we did not have to reclline the front seat to make that happen as another reviewer has said).  It folds easily, steers BEAUTIFULLY, and is as compact as a single stroller (though a little bit longer).  The FEW improvements it could use is that the storage basket underneath is rather small and could be difficult to get to, it would be nice to have a drink holder for mom and dad (keys, wallets, ect. can go in that small mesh bag on the back of the seat) but drink holders can be picked up most anywhere, and the front seat does not recline very far at all (but most kids when tired can fall asleep most anywhere although it can't really be used with an infant unless they're in an infant carier to recline in), it would also be nice if there was some sort of locking mechanism to keep the back bench from sliding  But these issues are very minor for us.  I had a baby trend sit and stand for my now 7 year old and 3 year old when the 3 year old was born and hardly ever used it, I hated it.  The baby trend sit and stand did not fold down well, did not have a seat belt on the back seat to keep my then 4 year old seated, did not have a 5 point harness or a snack/drink tray in the front for baby, and did not have as much space in the back for the older child, it also diid not have that locking mechanism for the back bench, the universal car seat attachment was more difficult to use than the one that comes with the JOOVY so we simply never bothered with it .  The one plus that it DID have that the Joovy does not is that the front seat reclined quite far (but of course then there was no room in the back whatsoever).  I prefer the Joovy by far and my 3 year old son absolutely loves it as well, he thinks he's such a big boy riding in the back!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I did some research online about sit and stand strollers and was trying to decide between the Baby Trend LX Sit and Stand or the Joovy. I bought the Baby Trend because there were no local stores that carried the Joovy for me to look at it. So, I bought the Baby Trend, took it home, strolled around my house and found it was to big, I was hitting wall corners and could not see what was infront of me. I would have to lift the stroller to go around tight corners. So, I went on the hunt to fond this Joovy stroller to test out. I finally found a retailer, drove 40 miles to test it out and it was worth it. I could manouver it well, I had my son sitting and my infant car seat attached and strolled around the store perfectly. It was easy to fold and pick up also. Attachments went on and came off easily. I was so pleased, wondering what the bad reviews were about, those people are crazy!! Here are some things I found were not hard or inconvienat at all that others did:1. The storage basket accessability: Yes, when your child is standing or sitting in the back area it is impossible to get to the basket from there, BUT WHY WOULD YOU ANYWAY???? The sides pull out so far that there is no need to access the basket any other way.2.The wheels do not turn well: OK, this has to be due to no readng the owners manual! There is a lock on the front wheels that keeps them from swiveling if in lock posistion. Once unlocked the wheels swivel to make sharp turns at ease. The only way I knew this is because I read the manual!3. The rear seat has little room when front seat in reclined: This is a fact, BUT the back seat slides back and forth, so if the seat is reclined you just pull the back seat foward more! AGAIN, READ THE MANUAL!4.No parent tray: OK, this was the only one that I can say is valid. BUT, there are so many universal trays out there and accessories to hold drinks, phones, MP3 players, ect that this should not be a big deal. Joovy sales one for the stroller, which is a little pricey, but I bought a off brand for a quarter of the price and it works great.So, overall I LOVE this stroller and I am so happy I went with it and not the Baby Trend. It is great when shopping in retail stores, manuovers great and my older son can get in and out easily without me breaking my back lifting his 35 pound body. If you are questioning to buy this product online, in my opinion, DO IT, you will not be disappointed unless you want more cup holders than needed and a heavy uncomfortable stroller!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I was looking for a stroller that would accommodate my 2 1/2 year old and my 6 month old and not to pricey. This stroller definitely met that criteria.  It's a little heavy but what can you expect from a dole stroller. I drive a 4 door Nissan Altima and it fits just fine in my trunk. In fact I can fit this stroller and a smaller stroller in the trunk. I do however have to remove the car seat adapter in order for the stroller to fit. But I can leave the sunshade and the cup holder on.Likes: compact, easy to open and close, the apple green is vibrant, comes with a drink holder for the kids, fits my peg perego car seat, car seat is easy to fit into and remove from the stroller.Dislikes: storage space is small, the seat does not recline to far back.All in all I would recommend this stroller!",4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","We absolutely love this stroller!  It's easy to put together,  easy to maneuver and easy to fold. My kids are comfortable and we use it during long outings.",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I'll start with the con---it's heavy and the parent organizer cost extra.  Now the positives are it fits my Chicco car-seat perfectly! It's great for my NB son and 2 1/2 year daughter. she sometimes sits and sometimes walks.  When she is to big to sit then I can still use the stroller. Not like the doubles that I would  be pushing a huge empty stroller around.  great for those with two young kids (just not twins).  I also like the material-durable feel and easy to wipe. Very little assembly required- I did it myself in 20 mins and no tools.  Ps- I was able to purchase this for 99$ from joovy website with free shipping.  So lookout for special offers. AND yes there is little room for child on bench when front seat reclined-but my DD doesn't seem to care and can still sit.  Maybe a chubby child would have difficulty.....,4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","We got this to replace a side by side double jogger. Our baby (nearly a toddler) sits comfortably up front. Our other kids (2, 4 and 6) have all taken turns both sitting and standing in the back of the stroller. The stroller was easy to assemble, folds up nicely and is fairly easy to push. The wheels are hard plastic. As a result, my wife was able to push the stroller the other day with one of the wheels locked. Most of the time this won't be an issue. I guess I just prefer the extra grip from rubber tires.",4,1
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,It was purchased for my grandson. My daughter specifically asked for this type of Nipple Drop-Ins.I got what she wanted.,5,1
14X29 Bassinet Pad,I bought a bassinet and it had this really thin and flimsy bassinet pad to go with it.  I was horrified that it would somehow suffocate my son so I got this one.  It is a perfect fit and I love it...trouble now is finding bassinet sheets to fit.,5,1
Dr. Seuss Sun Protective Bucket Hat - Pink &amp; Magenta: 0-12 Months,This is a great item and one of the best things I have bought for my grandbaby.  She's been wearing it outside since she's four months old.  It has really helped keeping the sun off her head and neck.,5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,Works with munchkin gates. We have this at the bottom of our stairs and I was able to secure our gate with the help of this item.,5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,"I have one of those pain in the butt stairs with a metal banister on one side that makes attaching a child gate very difficult. I bought these spindles with the kidco gate and they worked great for securing the gate at the bottom of the stairs.  One caveat I would add is that I would not trust this at the top of my stairs, if that was the case I would have attached a board and secured the pressure cups.",5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,Works great. Stays in place no matter the shape of the spindle and easy to use. Would definitely recommend for banister stairs.,5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,Great product; did what it said it was going to do; we use it to keep our older pet from going up the stairs,5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,"I was a little skeptical about how this was going to work, but I have spindles on one side of my staircase and stained wooden molding on the other side, so I didn't want to drill any holes.  The other kits were wooden pieces that went around the spindles, and didn't look very good in my opinion.  Since my spindles are black iron, I got the black Kidco gate which is pressure mounted.  These are very sturdy and the entire system was very easy to install.  It also looks good!!! I would definitely recommend these over any other spindle kit.",5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,Solid. I just wish the spindle adapters had black or brown ends so it is not so obvious up against our dark brown spindles.,4,1
Kidco Y Spindle,"Works well, could use a rubber cap to keep it from scratching or marring your painted surface.. but all in all, a good solid product.",5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,The accessory is exactly what I was looking for. The price is great at this store. And I received the items in 2 days.,5,1
Kidco Y Spindle,"Works great, but son figured out pretty quickly how to bump open the gate when it's not locked.  Will need to lock for most clever toddlers.",4,1
Kidco Y Spindle,"Others on here have discussed how well this works, so I think I will provide a little detail of our exact experience.  We originally purchased a well reviewed, non-pressure mounted baby gate for our stairs.  However, I realized the assembly was far too complicated, so instead we purchased an additional KidCo G15.  We already had two and were extremely happy with their simplicity and quality.One side of our staircase is a wall, so it presented no problems.  The other is a wrought iron gate, so it presented plenty of problems.  At first, I only ordered one Y Spindle, then realized when I received it that you actually need two, one for the top (as you see in the picture of the Y Spindle) and the other for the bottom (not pictured).  We got our second one and installed it and couldn't be happier.  It is SO easy and SO simple compared to the other remedies I found that I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with a similar problem.",5,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos",THIS IS A GREAT LUNCH SACK. IT HOLDS PLENTY AND THE MATERIAL IS HIGH QUALITY. IT KEEPS THINGS COOL AND THE VELCRO IS REALLY STRING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.,5,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos","I absolutely love the Sugar Booger line of items. I've bought a few great aprons for my son and birthday parties which were excellent quality. So when it came time to find a lunch bag, I didn't hesitate when the matching bag came up on my search results. It didn't disappoint. My son loves this bag and it's very easy to clean. I haven't noticed any signs of mold though we've only had it a couple months. I feel that for $15 I wouldn't be terribly upset replacing it once or twice a year IF it ever came to that",5,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos","This is the second Sugarbooger lunch sack I have bought on Amazon. The first one has worked out so well that I just bought this cute monster one for my son to take with him to preschool. It is laminated so it is easy to wipe down inside and out. We load ours with a stainless steel eco-lunchbox stacker (which fits perfectly) or a Foogo Thermos and maybe a granola bar or a piece of fruit. I'm pretty sure it will also fit Lunchbots or most rectangular food containers and bentos. It holds more than enough food, is easy to carry and clean, and comes in super cute prints. The only thing it lacks (and why I'm not awarding it five stars) is an exterior pocket or mesh to put a water bottle in. If only it had a place for a water bottle it would be darn near perfect for the price!",4,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos","Even with it's super cute pattern, this has been very functional for my family. My son has severe food allergies and I carry a backpack whereever we go. I keep his medicine in this sack, inside the backpack to keep the temps down. I'm sure there are easier ways to protect his medicines but none this cute.",5,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos","This lunch sack is REALLY cute in person. It wipes clean with a cloth and is about the same size as the traditional brown paper sack. I wouldn't recommend it for any kind of liquid, though. Sippy cups fit fine, but the bag is difficult to clean if it gets wet and molds really quickly. We tried it twice and had each for less than 4 weeks. Would be great for an older, DRY sack lunch (think PBJ and an apple).",4,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos",Well made. I bought it for a surprise for my sister. I know she will love it because we saw it at a museum gift store for 50% more (so we didn't but at the time). Very happy.,5,1

Princess Homecoming Keepsake Frame &amp; Ink Pad,"This is a sweet gift to give to parents that just had a little girl. Also comes in blue for boys. Parents can place a photo, hand print, foot print, or both, and mom and dad can place a keepsake or two to be framed. Can't go wrong with this gift. I would recommend this any time.",4,1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Ear Thermometer,"I love it! This pacifier thermometer is ideal for young infants, providing comfort to the child while letting you check baby's temperature. Quick and easy to understand, I suggest you to buy also probe covers to keep it clean.  One of the best tools, if you have kids around!",5,1
"Britax Parkway Booster Car Seat, Onyx","I had a third child on the way and my older two are still in boosters (ages five and eight). My car is small and I discovered I couldn't fit our baby seat between the boosters we had. This booster is narrow enough that I can fit all three seats in my car. It is also far nicer than the boosters we had before (would have bought this one first if I had known). It's very adjustable (height)and very easy to take in and out. It's padded, even by my eight year old's head. My kids say they're very comfortable, though they would both like to switch to boosters without backs. As a mom, I prefer the extra head and neck support even if it's minimal. Nice booster!",5,1
HABA Blossoms Pacifier Chain,My daughter loves this! And I do too! A good way to keep track of her binky and makes it easier for her to carry it around! It's good quality and I love that Haba has all natural products! Highly recommend! Extremely fast shipping too!!!,5,1

"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Brownstone",Our son is on the big side and this seat is perfect for him.We previously had the Roundabout and it was great too ... but seemed to be already small for him. The Boulevard is more cushioned and our son seems more comfortable. I would highly recommend Britax -- worth every penny!,5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Brownstone","Failed to post this review when purchased a couple years ago.  My son is now 4 & still fits in this seat.  He has nearly outgrown it but it still fits him (for now).  I feel that this seat is extremely safe & worth the extra $.  I have recommended this seat to everyone that I know who is either expecting a child or moving their child out of the infant seat.  Although this seat can be used for a newborn, I would recommend the carseat/carrier style for easy baby transport to & from the car.  I put my son in this seat once he outgrew his infant carrier seat.",5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Brownstone","We looked at tons of baby seats when our son outgrew his infant seat. I wanted something that would still fit as he got bigger. It has the added bonus of being airline certified, so if we ever need to fly somewhere I know that he will be buckled up safely. My husband says that it's a dream to install and we can switch it easily to grandpa's car. I also like the peace of mind knowing that it has a high safety rating. It was very expensive, but I believe that it's worth it and it is good up to 100lbs, so I plan to use it for several years.",5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx","This was well worth every penny, I got it as a first car seat, and plan to keep it until my duahgter is done with car seats!!! Cery sturdy, easy to clean, as a first time car seat user, it took a little while to get used to, but now it is a breeze to set up and take out of the car. Highly recommend!",5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx",We read numerous reviews before purchasing this car seat and were concerned about the size of this seat. I already own the Britax Mooflage Marathon and had it in my Saturn Outlook but decided to put the Regent in my car and the Marathon in my husbands Volkswagen Jetta! The Regent is a very large seat and probably not the best for a compact vehicle. My 2 year old son loves his new seat but the only complaint I have is that now my little one can't see out of the window but when he gets bigger I am sure it will be fine. Seat is very sturdy and the material is soft! I highly recommend this seat and give it five stars!!!!!!!!!!,5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx","My just turned three year old loves this seat.  The only thing is, He is little-- only 37"" and 27 lbs and can't see out of the window anymore. It doesn't seem to bother him though.  He'll grow quickly enough. The seat was super easy to install in my Corolla, I love the latch system, so much easier than other brands of seats.  The seat is large, but fits nicely in my Corolla, but I can't fit 2 people in the back.  I couldn't either though when I had the Evenflo Triumph back there.I have a rental Ford Fusion right now and the latch bracket is under the seat, so that made it a bit more difficult to install.All in all, this is a wonderful seat.",5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx","I bought 3 of these for my 7 year old, 5 year old and 3 year old, this is the greatest forwrd facing car seat $$$ can buy!  I feel very secure that they are safe, best insurance you can buy to save your child(rens) lives!  Easy to install, but large.",5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx",We ordered this car seat for our 2 year old daughter.  She is almost 37 inches and was too big for her other car seat so we decided to go with Britax.  I researched alot of car seats and everything you read about Britax is positive.  We love that it goes up to 80 pounds.  We love the 5 point harness which is a must for car seats these days.  Our daughter used to fuss and cry when we had to put her in her old car seat.  From day one of putting her in this one she has not made a peep she loves it.  It is very roomy for her and she is 36 pounds and almost 37 inches tall.  She has plenty of room to grow in it and is very comfy in it.  She no longer crys when we have to put her in the seat and now actually can get up in it herself.  It was very easy to install and is very stable car seat.  You will love it I wish I origonally went with a Britax from the begining.  I recomend it to anyone.,5,1
"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx","My 4-year-old has been in an Apex which is ok but he is very long waisted and has already reached the last shoulder notch in the seat and I want to keep him in a 5-point harness.  I was excited to find the Regent at a decent price and ordered one.  It arrived the other day and I have to say it is huge.  In fact, it's so big I made my 62 pound 8-year-old sit in it.  He's on the second shoulder notch from the top so he still has room to grow in this thing!  I was worried he wouldn't want to sit in it seeing as he had gone to a backless booster but he said the Regent was super comfy and was happy to use it.I won't even tell you about the huge argument that erupted between my two boys over the older one getting the Regent.  It was a bit ugly.So my four-year-old will stay in the Apex for now and my 8-year-old is safe and sound in the Regent.  Everyone is happy and safe.Install was simple on this seat and the seat is very secure in my Honda Odyssey.Now I am debating whether to buy another Regent when my little one finally outgrows the Apex or make the 8-year-old give it up.All around a good seat.  It is huge but it will fit an eight-year-old.  And it looks so nice and feels so comfy that he actually wants to sit in it!",5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",Another great Britax carseat.  Easy and fast to install.  Baby seems super comfortable.  The seat seems very safe.  Absolutely no complaints.,5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I love this seat. my daughter is very comfortable in it. She used to cry all the time in her infant seat. We have the companion and while it was a safe seat (Britax of course) I think it was time to move on. This is an extremely sturdy seat when installed properly feels very safe. It's also a great looking seat. The only drawback is that it is a pain to get in her and out of it, takes a while to snap the harness together and sometimes makes her upset. But once we get going she's ok and I feel good that she is safe.  The part between the legs where you snap the two buckles always moves down so you have to hold baby up with one hand and hold that piece forward so you can get them in without having to shove your hand underneat the babies rear! Not fun.  However, this isn't enough to deter me from using it and recommending it. Small price to pay for a very safe/sturdy seat.",5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This is a great product & feel very comfortable knowing my baby girl is safe in this seat. It was easy to install & fits very well in my car. I feel it takes up less room then our infant seat. Granted it is higher so I can't use here baby mirrior to see her unless I put my visor down & use the mirror in there to see her. As for the delivery it was awful. UPS just threw it on my door step in the rain! I called Amazon Customer service & they where supposed to ship me a new one. Per UPS they delivered, but I never received. So I kept original seat & Amazon gave me a credit for my trouble. Other then the delivery it was a good experience.",5,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I just bought two of the Shannon's for our daughter and they fit both vehicles we own. One is a 2003 Expedition and the other is a 2005 Escape. She is only seven months old and just outgrew her infant seat. Both are in the rear-facing position and fit just fine. I had to anchor the tether to the front passenger seat frame, as that makes the seat feel the most stable. Once she is one year old and I turn them around, then I will tether them towards the back of the second row. Also, this does fit in the middle of the seat for both vehicles. It is a bit tight if someone wants to sit next to her, but my wife and I fit fine. I am 5'9"" and it is fine. I bought them when they were cheap. Do not pay $299 for them as the price is always changing. If they get below $250 snatch them up. This is a great price with free shipping and no sales tax!! Yes, they are a bit expensive, but when it comes to my child's safety, these were well worth the price.",5,1
Eddie Bauer Voyager High Back Booster,"We received this car seat as a gift for my 1year old's birthday.  It is a great looking car seat.  I have found it to be easy to get my son in and out of it.  So far we have had no problems with this car seat other than the wear on it. I found it obtained little balls on it like as if I had inproperly washed it (I haven't washed it yet).  Other than that I like it a lot and would recommend it, expecially for the price!!!",4,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub Deluxe,"Well, everything I said below is true but now 10 months later the tub has developed it's 3rd leak so we have to inflate it every night with a foot pump. I'm giving up and ordering another one. Not bad for every day use for 10 months though.My original review:When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using. We couldn't find the snug tub in any of the stores (Babies R Us carries their own brand, Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small).With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm. She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible.Well this tub is the answer. It is everything the reviewers have said - convenient (blow up once and store with suction hook), big (lots of room for toys and splashing), secure (fits very snugly, thus the name) and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it. And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys. Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish. So bath with peace of mind and have fun with the little one!",5,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub Deluxe,"Like the other reviewer, I needed something my daughter could splash around in while I took a shower.  By the way, I'm sure neither of us leave our children unattended.  We want our children to accompany us as we bathe, so I purchased this tub, as she had grown out of her other tubs.  It is a great tub.  It is large in size, but we have a very large shower, so it works great for us.  It does work great in the regular tub too.  My daughter can't wait to climb in.  The only drawback is mine got a tear in the side, but we had it for a while, so I'm going to purchase another one. You also can't find inflatable tubs very easily.  I highly recommend this tub.",4,1

Kolcraft Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I have a Graco Snug Ride II carseat...I selected this stroller frame because I had a gift certificate that covered the cost of it so it would be free.Upon assembly, we attempted to attach the car seat to the stroller frame.  The instructions made it look like the back part of the car seat should snap onto the frame.  Our car seat does not.Called customer service, got a prompt friendly associate on the phone who informed me that Graco Snugride II will not snap onto this frame, but that the safety strap should adequately secure the seat to the frame.So for that, I take away one star.However, the other four stars are well deserved.  Here's why:1. It fits in the trunk of my Honda Civic with room to spare.2. It is lightweight.3. You truly CAN open and close it with one hand, LOVE THIS!!4. The ride is SMOOTH regardless of terrain.5. The handle is just right for a 5 ft 2 mom.  No back strain or arm tiredness from improper height.6. The basket on the bottom is SPACIOUS and easy to access.  Big ole diaper bag and Mom's purse fit nicely.7. The parent tray is spacious and holds keys.As for a recommendation, I am on the fence.  I would prefer for the seat to snap onto the frame, this still bothers me.  However, all the other features are important and work well for this product, including availability of customer service to quickly answer questions.  So I would say I am 51% leaning towards a ""Would Recommend"" for the Kolcraft Universal Car Seat Carrier...",4,1
The First Years - Nursing Privacy Wrap Black,"I bought this wrap for my first child for travelling in a single seat in economy on airplanes but never needed to use it because I luckily always got given an extra seat.  With baby two I have used this so much I can't believe I didn't the first time.  The trick is to adapt it.  I realise this isn't what most people want - more work with a newborn - but it is possible to create something that isn't out there on the market.I chopped off the tie on one side, sewed up the seam to match the other side, then sewed 2-way velcro around the neck hole.  It still works fine for discreet breastfeeding but with the stiffness of the velcro the neck sticks out a bit so you can see your baby handsfree.  Then it doubles (or quadruples) to hang over the top of a car seat, velcro-ing round the handle to black out/sunsheild; drap over a bassinet, velcro-ing up completely; or slipping over the handlebar of some double strollers to black out/sunsheild the baby in the back (I have a Phil n Teds), the loop at the bottom also happens to loop round a toggle on the stroller that stops it blowing up.  The fabric is such that it is lightweight but dense so it completely blacks out if your baby (as most babies do) sleeps longer in the dark or if you live in a sunny climate.  I also love only having to carry one item around with me to do all these things.  I probably agree that it could be a little longer but the ventilation is good at this length.",4,1
Baby Einstein Move &amp; Go Music Mirror,"I bought this seat and my 2 1/2 month old loves it.  The seat is big and long and looks likeit will accommodate her for months to come.  The lights on the caterpillar definitely hold her attention.  She also loves the two hanging toys that she can bat and pull at.  The toys can easily be switched out, too, with your own if your child gets sick of them.  The lights/music can be set to play automatically or can be set to turn on when your child bats the hanging toys.  The caterpillar bar also easily removes if you just want to use it as a seat.Great purchase!",5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,I would definitely recommend this blender. It really purees food for my little one and is easy to clean. I've also used it for myself. Great buy!!!,5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"my friend recommended this product after making her own baby food exclusively. It is very easy to put together and take apart for cleaning. I've done carrots, apples, pears and avocados. It produces very fine baby food that's easy to swallow. Takes up very little space and is not very loud. I have no complaints about this product.",5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"I got this when my son was around 8 months old, when I decided that buying jarred baby food so often was too expensive. I wish I had gotten it sooner. It is easy to use, and easy to clean. Everything just goes in the dishwasher.Works well for cooked veggies, fruit, and even cooked chicken. Just add a little water to adjust the puree thickness.I am not much of a cook, and I still use some jarred baby food, but this is really handy. The capacity makes about 4 portions that I can freeze. I end up using it once a week or so - I do several different batches. I didn't want to invest in a more robust appliance that I wouldn't use much in the future, so the price point of this has made me feel like I already got my money's worth. I still use it and my son is almost 11 months. He is eating a combination of finger foods and chunkier foods, but he still likes to be spoonfed.I definitely recommend this if you are thinking about making your own baby food sometimes, and don't want to spend a lot of money.Note: the motor is really loud, and it scares my son. So I use it mostly when he is sleeping. I have even taken out to the garage (right beside the kitchen) to muffle the sound.",4,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"Started to introduce solid foods and ordered this based on others ratings. This is the food processor is perfect for making baby food, very easy to use and clean and small enough to leave out on counter.  Makes perfectly paste like baby food. Tiny blades are sharp be careful!!!",5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"I am a first time mom & could not ask for a better food processor or mill. i like everything about it, i know there were some complains about the turbo button, but i like it. All i have to do is put my steamed vegetables in the pot covert it then put the lid on & it will pure it right away. i will recomend it. it is not expensive & do the job i want.",5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"I love it! Easy to clean, easy to operate, food come out perfect for my baby, nothing better than this kidco food procesor.",5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,I love this electric food mill.  I had a Kidco hand mill which I still use for bananas and when we are out of the house.  I've used this electric mill to do all my baby's food.  It's simple to use with easy clean up.,5,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"it's a gate. it fits in the door, it's tight, it keeps the dogs out of the bedroom, not much more to say, When my wife and have a child we'll definitely buy another from this company if we need another.",4,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,perfect for keeping doors sealed from animals. easy to attach to side of doorways. the extension is very easy to control.,5,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,We installed this on the banister at the top of the stairs. it came with all the hardware needed to mount on a hinge and is relatively easy to install. the installation instructions are helpful and provide accurate measurements on how to mount.Con:the gate is difficult to slide in/out to make shorter or wider.it is very difficult to unlatch the lock once it is in place.,4,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"Not liking it is not a reason to reduce stars right? I just don't like it. There is nothing wrong with it. It works great for flat walls (I have to mount it up a little higher because of base boards). It is a pressure gate. It creates a fair amount of pressure. That is really what hangs me up though, the pressure is built up by a strange lever with 3 locking positions so you have to get it set up right to get the lever down to the positions. And I don't like it. Also, I have a little bit of trouble getting it to hold the same length every move in and out of the hall. But, it was cheap and it does the job and it is durable and I can't really say anything is wrong with it.",5,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,Baby gate was bought for doorway from living room to kitchen ... good and sturdy for the price. installation only took a few minutes and hardware was used. very happy and will be ordering another one for the babies door way this week,4,1

North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"I used this gate between my kitchen and dining room area doorway. Great for what it's intended for however, when my 23 month old now found out he can use the middle part to gain leverage on climbing over it, that posed a bit of an issue.",4,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"We use this for our dog to keep her out of the family room when we are not home, she likes to do antics down there.  great quality gate for the price.  A little tricky at first to figure out the locking mechanism and get it lined up to stay in place.  You have to set up the one side flush with the wall then the other side will automatically lock in,  if not the gate will move and and be loose.  User error would be the result of a bad review of this gate.  Quality is great considering the price.  I can understand the frustration though if you had to keep going in and out, refitting the gate.  Works great for my dog.",5,1
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,didn't go for what we wanted for my stair but it's okay.  this is the only cheaper one and also i would say durable.,4,1
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Classic Polka Dots, Pastel Pink","I am now using this with my second baby, three years after purchase, and it has held up so well throughout weekly washings for so long.  I don't know why this swaddle blanket is listed with hooded towels, the chocolate brown polka dots is a blanket, not a towel.  The size is great for swaddling and it is soft cotton flannel.  Now that my baby is no longer swaddled, we use it as a blanket on top of him.  Also great as a throw over a stroller or car seat.  So much bigger than other receiving blankets.  This would make a great baby gift!",5,1
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Classic Polka Dots, Pastel Pink",I LOVE swaddle designs. These are great blankets that are extra big and warm for winter nights for newborns.  Great gift idea!,5,1
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Classic Polka Dots, Pastel Pink",These are super soft flannel blankets. Thick and warm and a generous size. I love the polka dot print. The trim of the blanket is nice too. I love this company and have bought other blankets from them. I will probably buy more. The size is a great so baby can use it as he gets older.. I recommend anything from SwaddleDesigns,5,1
Parents of Invention Teeny Towels - Antibacterial Wipes 8 Pack,"I was recently on a trip to China and took these teeny towels with me for sanitation purposes.  The little chain easily looped around my backpack, the towels remainied moist for the entire 4 weeks. The only thing I would improve would be to put a better fastner on the chain because the plastic box was banged around quite a bit as I traveled and the chain came undone a  couple of times.  But overall for general purposes, it was great.",4,1
Chicco Keyfit Car Seat Base,Not much to say since the product is a base unit to hold a baby carrier.  It functions as advertised.,5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red",I love that it hooks on to my island even though I have a lip on it.  It's a great product!,5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red",This is a great chair!  We take it everywhere we go.  It will hook on to most tables but at least our daughter does not have to sit in the restaurant high chairs (gross!)  It is very handy.  It could use some type of clip to keep the legs together when it is folded up.,5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","This is one of the best ideas for parents that love to travel.  This means you can carry one less bulky item with you.  I have never had it not work at a given table (sometimes you have to work around obstacles) and the result is a secure seat.  Its easy to clean as you can detach the cloth throw it in the wash machine and just wipe down the rest.  I would say this is a must have if you want to travel with a kid too small for a booster seat.  My only tiny complaint is that when it folds up there is nothing on the device to keep the arms folded together.  This is easy solved however with any kind of reusable string, rope, ribbon, etc.",5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red",Lightweight. Very durable. Excellent price. Easy to set up and take down. Would highly recommend this product. Perfect for daily use or travel.,5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","I use this high chair in a restaurant. It is fantastic. Easy to use, easy to clean, and durable. Best one I have found",5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","This has been great to have with us while eating out. Not that I'm against germs (good to build the immune system, ya know) however, this is east to attach and I know that when my boy is eating in this seat, it's only his spit and food mess that he has in it. Pretty nasty to think about using the seats at places and not knowing if anyone cleans them...or, how well they are cleaned if cleaned... Only thing to be aware of is that some tables have support bars on the bottom of them that could make using this seat a little challenging at times. However, this I've found to be the exception...then we use the seat available where we are.",5,1
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","Very sturdy, easy to clean, i just wipe all over it with a wet towel after each meal. Baby seems very confortable in it and safe. Im not giving it 5 stars because baby already hit the back of his head twice. Not too hard he didnt get hurt, it has some foam to protect him  but why not make it more cushioned to support his head. Other than that price is great and no need to spend the extra bucks for the new design with the hippos  and such. This one is easy to take apart and reasemble and very light. It says itDoesnt work on a glass table but mine is workingperfeclty fine. Only con is that it cant rotate and It would definatly be more useful if you could rotate it like the chico one.",4,1
Medela Quick Clean Breastpump &amp; Accessory Wipes,"Used these to clean my nipple shields in between uses.  They were bigger than I needed so I would cut them in 1/2 and save one in a ziplock bag so it wouldn't dry out.  Also, came in handy when my breast shields would fall on the floor at work : (",5,1
Medela Quick Clean Breastpump &amp; Accessory Wipes,These made it much easier to keep breastpump accessories sanitary when away from home and/or without soap and water. Plenty of wetness in each wipe to thoroughly clean my breastpump equipment.,5,1
Medela PersonalFit Connectors,"Just as I expected.  Would be nice if they were packaged with the yellow part and flap, but it is exactly how they advertise.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Connectors,"I need to pump twice at work, so I bought these connectors. It works perfect! The shipping is fast too.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I wasn't sure if changing the breastshields on my Pump in Style would really make much difference, but it was definitely worth it!  Pumping is much more comfortable and more efficient since I bought the proper size shields.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,I have 2 children and only pump a bottle for special occasions but since ordering this size I pump more often.  Having the correct size makes pumping more comfortable.,5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,I was debating about getting these and then read other people's reviews that said they wish they had gotten them sooner.  I couldn't agree more!  I didn't get them until I'd been pumping for 9 months and was feeling frustrated by not getting good suction or enough milk.  Finally I considered if I needed smaller breast shields and apparently I did because I literally get double the milk I used to get.  ARGH.  I really wish I had been using this size all along or had at least tried it.  I would have only had $15 to lose.  Trying not to cry over spilled milk so to speak but man-might have avoided some mastitis as well had I been emptying properly along the way.,5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,I am so happy to have finally received these. I have had such painful problems while pumping and after reading the Medela site and looking at the breast shield diagrams I knew the ones that came with the pump were too big. I am pumping right now and OMG what a difference! I am so happy I could cry...probably due to hormones! No pain!I dreaded pumping due to the pain it caused and the soreness afterwards. Everything feels better and it isn't rubbing or taking too much in. This is the perfect size!I wish Medela gave you options with the breast shields when you buy the pump. I mean for $300 bucks I shouldn't have to pay an additional $15 to get the right size! They should really give options when getting these pumps so you don't have problems with pain and discomfort.,5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"Pumping with this size breastshield is so much more comfy than using the 24mm that come with the Medela pumps. I have large nursing boobs (size 36 DDD) and I followed the reviews I had read online that the larger breastshields were more comfortable for women with larger breasts. However, the 27mm shields ended up making my nipples very sore and they felt like they pinched when I pumped. I actually started to bleed, but was so novice at the time, I had no idea that pumping could actually be comfortable. Now that I have the small size, I enjoy pumping almost as much as nursing my 5 week old baby.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"worked great - came as expected -- they are a little thicker than the standard ones that come with the medela pumps -- but worked great! I ordered these as according to the medela &#34;fit&#34; photos , the standard shields were too big for me.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I am around 42G-H and these (30) seemed to fit better than the 36, and I got more out of pumping with this size.",4,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"SO much nicer than the medium/regular shields that come with the standard medela breast pump. Most nursing women need a larger size. Using the larger size IMMEDIATELY helped me to pump more milk with less pain! If you aren't sure about how well your breast shields fit you, I would recommend getting these to try. I didn't with my first child, waited till my second, and am kicking myself for waiting so long!",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"Not the size I ended up needing, but nothing was wrong with the product itself. Not going to give a lower rating just because they weren't my size, there really is no way to tell unless you try them.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"Exactly as advertised, the Medela PersonalFit Small 21 mm Breastshields were a much better fit for me than what came with the breast pump. I was able to get a better fit and therefore able to pump more milk.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"Best thing is that nipples don't get sore anymore, like when I was using the standard size. Getting the proper size breast shield matters and make a difference.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,I bought the Medela pump and on the first day of use felt pain and discomfort while pumping. I thought I am using the wrong size breastshield and I ordered these the same day. It took almost one week for the product to arrive and by then I kept feeling better everyday with the 24 mm shields. I didnt notice an increase in supply or improved comfort with these 21 mm shields. I just needed to get used to the pump. Do wait for atleast a week to see if the shield size is the problem.,4,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,Bought these because my lactation consultant recommended... I am a D cup and these are definitely more comfortable than the standard ones that came with pump!,5,1

BABYBJORN Baby Diaper Bag Dynamic - City Black,"This is one of the best diaper bags that ever see. Good choice for any on the road parents, plenty equipped with a bunch of compartments to have everything well organized.Simply the best for your child!",5,1
BABYBJORN Baby Diaper Bag Dynamic - City Black,"This is a very nice diaper bag. I just purchased because I need it now for 2 children, and it fits a lot of stuff. The backpack feature is great because it leaves your hands and arms completely free. It is a little bulky... But I looked all over and you just cant get that amount of space in any diaper bag, without it being bulky, its either bulky and roomy or compact and reduced in space. I really like this bag, and it matches great with the Baby Bjorn Carrier and Carrier cover.",4,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,This item was a great fit for my child. She took a little getting used to the springs and getting off the ground. But as soon as she did she loved it.  Great way to exercise her little legs.,4,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"My little guy LOVES to jump. At three months old he had very good head control so we let him try it and he has not stopped jumping since! Sometimes he jumps himself to sleep and then we carry him off to bed. This item is great for those nights when your little one wakes way too early and won't go back down. Just put them in and lay on the couch nearby and they will jump away! Pair it with Disney Channel for some kid music and my little guy jumps to the beat. It is too cute. I am going to be sad when he outgrows it which given the 25 lb. weight limit and 32"""" height limit he will be out of it before 10 months. But what a great 7 months it gave us ;o)",5,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"Our daughter started using this when she was 3 1/2 months old and loved it from the start. She needed to warm up to other toys and activity mats but this she took to right away. She didn't start jumping in it until 4 1/2 months of age but she still had fun with the attached play toys and even just looking at the """"scenery"""" on the side panels. She can entertain herself in it for hours and we feel comfortable letting her go wild in it with the sturdy construction. A definite must have for babies - and parents!",5,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,For independent babies this toy is a must.  My son loves to stand up--but unfortunately I do not have the time to support him all day.  The Jumperoo helps when mom has to do her many other tasks.  Love this toy!,5,1
